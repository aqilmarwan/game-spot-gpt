Wonder Preview Afghani has a relatively small list of credits so far, with his most notable other project being Genshin Impact, where he voices Arnold. Dataminers previously believed that Mick Wingert, another actor whose name was listed in hacked files, would be voicing Mario, but this is obviously not the case. Back in August, Nintendo confirmed fan speculation that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would not be voicing the character in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Martinet instead would be transitioning into a new role as a \"Mario ambassador,\" where he will travel the world to interact with fans. However, despite Nintendo announcing Martinet's departure, it didn't reveal who would be taking up the Mario mantle in his place, leaving fans to wildly speculate. Via Video Games Chronicle, a datamined list of voice actors allegedly from a hacked kiosk demo of Super Mario Bros. Wonder intended for US retail stores made its way online earlier this week. Though anyone can post anything on the internet and claim it to be true, the original poster did attach screenshots for previously unseen levels from World 1 of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, lending the list of datamined voice actors an air of authenticity. Wingert's name was included, as was Afghani's, though the latter was considered less likely to voice Mario, for whatever reason. Other revelations to come out of the datamine include the suggestion that longtime Daisy voice actor Deanna Mustard has been recast. Other voice actors, like Samantha Kelly, appear to be returning to play previous roles, with Kelly likely returning to her role as Peach, Toad, and Toadette. That being said, it's best to take all of the speculation and datamining deducing with a grain of salt for now. Super Mario Bros. Wonder releases on October 20 for Nintendo Switch.

He also divulged that the last time a new PlayStation Vita unit was sold in the US was November 2021. Three units were sold then. Some people wondered how it might be possible that the Wii U was able to sell even one unit this year because hardware manufacturers are known to buy back stock after production has concluded. That may be the case for Wii U, but Piscatella pointed out that it's entirely possible some units meant to be bought back were actually returned. The Wii U was the successor to the hugely popular Wii console, and it didn't exactly catch on in the market in the way that Nintendo wanted. It ended its run with 13.56 million in unit sales and 103.6 million in game sales. Those are the lowest hardware and software numbers for any Nintendo platform in the company's history (except for the Virtual Boy). For comparison, the Switch has sold 129.5 million units and more than 1 billion games. A new Nintendo console was reportedly shown to developers at Gamescom in August and could launch in 2024.

You can get early access to the Dark Crusader as a starting class by purchasing the Deluxe Edition of the game for $80. This is $10 more than the standard version of the title, so unless you're desperate to begin your very first playthrough with the Dark Crusader, we'd recommend unlocking the class in-game using the method below.

Take a right out of the boss arena and find it at the very end of the path. Learn about Isaac's story via Umbral stigmasYou'll need to examine four Umbral stigmas throughout the game that tell Isaac's story. You'll need to be in the Umbral Realm to find and soulflay these. Lower Calrath (Depot vestige) - Backtrack from the vestige just a little to find a stigma of Isaac kneeling. Fief of the Chill Curse (Fief vestige) - Look in the same location as the vestige to find another stigma of Isaac kneeling. Fief of the Chill Cruse (Nest vestige) - After defeating the boss near the vestige, continue onward and take a ladder down in the same tower as the beacon. Pass through the two large rocks into a massive arena (you may have to fight a boss here depending on how you've progressed the game). Exit the other end of the arena to find a stigma of Isaac on the ground. Path of Devotion (Memorial vestige) - From the vestige, run down the narrow pathway into an open section with lots of enemies. You'll spot the stigma of Isaac peering over the site in the back of this area. Defeat Isaac in combatAfter completing the above requirements, you can access a fight against Isaac in the Path of Devotion. Past the area you find the final stigma and down some steps is another open section with some enemies to defeat. While in the Umbral Realm, there will now be a path open here that leads you into an arena. Soulflay the stigma to engage in a battle with Isaac, who shouldn't pose any major issues as long as you're sufficiently leveled. When he dies, you'll score the Umbral-Tinged Flayed Skin. Retrieve Isaac's gearFast travel to the Sepulchre vestige and return to where you first found the Flayed Skin. Enter the Umbral Realm, use the Umbral-Tinged Flayed Skin to open the giant door, and then walk down to a platform below to pick up Isaac's sword, armor, and rosary. Summon Isaac against the LightreaperAfter completing every other requirement, you can now summon Isaac against the Lightreaper in Upper Calrath. Unfortunately, it appears that if you've already defeated the Lightreaper here, you'll need to try this process again on a subsequent playthrough.

The journey will be long and perilous, often taking you to areas crawling with enemies. These all lead to a climactic encounter. Our guide discusses how to unlock the Radiant Ending in Lords of the Fallen, which also nets you the Radiant Purifier class. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains major spoilers. Table of Contents [hide]How to get the Radiant Ending and Radiant Purifier class in Lords of the FallenWhere to find all five beaconsHow to reach the final bossHow to defeat Adyr, the Bereft ExileThe Radiant Purifier class starting items and spellsHow to get the Radiant Ending and Radiant Purifier class in Lords of the FallenThe Lords of the Fallen Radiant Ending can be unlocked if you cleanse all five beacons. This makes it the most straightforward out of all three potential endings in the game. From there, you have to venture deeper into Bramis Castle and defeat Adyr, the Bereft Exile. Where to find all five beaconsThe five beacons in Mournstead can be found in the following locations:Forsaken Fen - Go through the swamps past where you fight Gentle Gaverus. Upper Calrath - This requires you to trek through the Lower Calrath slums, the mining complex, and the cistern, until you eventually reach the upper city. Fief of the Chill Curse/Kinrangr Fief - This is the snow area, where you'll do battle against Viking raiders and their cohorts. The Empyrean - This gigantic cathedral can be reached by way of the Leprosarium of the Hallowed Brothers and the Abbey of the Hallowed Sisters. Tower of Penance - One of the branching paths in the Leprosarium's courtyard leads to this tower. Bear in mind that each beacon is guarded by a Heresy-type boss (i. e. major boss or great foe), not to mention other bosses and elites that can be encountered along the way. As such, you need to be ready for these challenges. It's also worth noting that cleansing beacons can lock you out of the Rhogar Ending and Umbral Ending. Getting all three won't be possible in a single run, and you may need to use backup saves that still require you to spend numerous hours replaying entire portions of the game. Beacons are often defended by major Heresy-type bosses. How to reach the final bossOnce all five beacons have been cleansed, you're one step closer to reaching the Lords of the Fallen Radiant Ending. Here's a quick summary:Head to the large gate that's blocked by a rock formation in Upper Calrath. You'll have to defeat the Iron Wayfarer in this area. He's an NPC-turned-Sinner-miniboss. After passing through the gate, you need to take out Damarose the Marked, another NPC-turned-Sinner-miniboss. Continue onward past the lava flows and enter Bramis Castle, where you have to eliminate several Conflagrant Seers, Ruiners, and other Sinner bosses that are now regular enemies. You then have to beat a Heresy boss known as the Sundered Monarch. Once the Sundered Monarch is dead, interact with the tendril-covered doorway at the back of the throne room. This will take you to the Rhogar Realm. Gallery Bramis Castle (left) is overflowing with lava, and you need to reach the throne room (right) to enter the Rhogar Realm. How to defeat Adyr, the Bereft ExileThe final boss if you want to get the Radiant Ending in Lords of the Fallen is Adyr, the Bereft Exile. Yes, it's the demon god you've heard about since the start of the campaign. Funnily enough, this encounter doesn't involve fighting or damaging him directly. Adyr watches your every move. Here's what you can expect from the Lords of the Fallen Adyr final boss encounter:Adyr stands at the edge of the arena. There's an altar next to him, which acts like a timer of sorts. Your goal is to kill all of the cultists in the arena. Be forewarned since they have fire-based attacks, explosions, and lava flows that cause the burn and ignite status effects. Every cultist that you kill whittles down Adyr's health. You need to be fast in eliminating all the hostiles since there's a hidden timer. Your cues come in to the form of the altar in front of Adyr, Adyr's own monologue, and the pulsing sound effect that beats faster if you're almost out of time. Once Adyr's HP has been fully depleted, a cutscene will trigger. Your character will bring out the Umbral Lamp, its power disintegrating Adyr completely. Then, your character will float in mid-air before being consumed by flames. Well, that doesn't seem like a happy ending at all, eh?Gallery After eliminating all the cultists (left), your Umbral Lamp will annihilate Adyr (right).

Transfusion Matrix triggers health regeneration and restores melee energy when you land an Arc melee kill with this helmet equipped. Looking at the numbers, the key highlight is a very high recovery rate and a high strength stat, which ties in nicely to the identity of this Exotic.

The cap on Exotic Ciphers has also increased, as you'll now be able to hold up to five of them at a time. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday. His exact location is always a mystery when he first arrives, as he is not listed on the map, and for novice players, he can be easy to miss. However, there are a set number of locations where he takes up residence, including the Tower Hangar area, on Nessus in Watcher's Grave, and in the Winding Cove area of the EDZ.

The deal faced a good amount of regulatory pressure, as Microsoft faced scrutiny from government groups around the world. Key legal battles took place in the United States and the UK. Microsoft announced the deal in February 2022. The announcement of the deal closing came just hours after the UK's CMA itself signed off, and this was the final regulatory hurdle that Microsoft needed to clear to close the deal. A key concern from the CMA centered on cloud gaming, and to help close the deal, Microsoft sold cloud-gaming rights to Ubisoft.\"All the games that are coming from Activision Blizzard in the next 15 years and those games that exist now, we have those streaming rights in perpetuity,\" Ubisoft said in its own announcement pertaining to the closure of the deal today. It's a done dealMicrosoft is paying Activision Blizzard $95 per share for the buyout. Microsoft's previous biggest acquisition was LinkedIn, which it paid $26.2 billion to acquire in 2016. For comparison, Disney bought Lucasfilm and the Star Wars series for $4.05 billion. As part of the buyout, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is apparently planning to resign. Other high-ranking Activision Blizzard C-suite executives are leaving, too. Kotick will stay on through the end of 2023 and will report to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer to help with the transition.

The Game Pass Twitter/X account said work \"can now begin\" to bring games from Activision Blizzard and King to Game Pass. \"We can't wait to share more details in the coming months,\" Microsoft said. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer reacted to the deal closing, writing, \"As one team, we'll learn, innovate, and continue to deliver on our promise to bring the joy and community of gaming to more people.\"He added: \"We'll do this in a culture that strives to empower everyone to do their best work, where all people are welcome, and is centered on our ongoing commitment of Gaming for Everyone.\"Spencer said in a memo to staff, \"We are eager to learn from their creativity, exchange insights and best practices, and empower our new colleagues to bring their visions to the widest possible audience.\" The Microsoft/Activision deal originally had a deadline to close of July 18, but the two companies renegotiated the terms of their pact and extended the deadline to October 18. In April, the UK's Competition & Markets Authority blocked the deal over concerns about the cloud gaming market. Microsoft and Activision secured a partial victory in July when the companies won a key court case with the FTC in the United States. Microsoft closed the deal today, October 13, which is just ahead of the October 18, 2023 deadline. Per the terms of the merger agreement, Microsoft would have had to pay Activision Blizzard a breakup fee of more than $4.5 billion if this deal didn't come together. Microsoft is buying the entirety of Activision Blizzard, which means Microsoft will now own and operate franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, and Warcraft, as well as King's popular Candy Crush games. Microsoft had said it didn't need to acquire Activision Blizzard to fulfill its gaming ambitions (and Activision said it would have been fine without being sold, too), but buying the Call of Duty giant will help Microsoft accelerate its plans. A key point in this saga has been Call of Duty, and in July of this year, Microsoft and Sony announced a 10-year deal to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms until at least 2033. Microsoft offered a 10-year deal to Sony months ago, but the PlayStation company only just agreed to it after the FTC decision. Microsoft also has a 10-year deal in place with Nintendo to bring future Call of Duty releases to the company's platforms, including potentially the Switch 2. No doubt there will be many additional developments and updates pertaining to this deal and the future of Xbox now that it has Activision Blizzard under its wing, so keep checking back for more. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer Statement:We love gaming. We play games, create games, and know first-hand how much gaming means to all of us as individuals and collectively, as a community. And today, we officially welcome Activision Blizzard and their teams to Xbox. They are the publishers of some of the most played and most beloved franchises in gaming history across console, PC and mobile. From Pitfall to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft to Overwatch, Candy Crush Saga to Farm Heroes Super Saga, their studios have pushed the boundaries of gaming for players around the world. I’ve long admired the work of Activision, Blizzard, and King, and the impact they’ve had on gaming, entertainment, and pop culture. Whether it was late nights spent playing the Diablo IV campaign with friends from start to finish, gathering the entire family in the rec room for our weekly Guitar Hero night, or going on an epic streak in Candy Crush, some of my most memorable gaming moments came from experiences their studios have created. It is incredible to welcome such legendary teams to Xbox. As one team, we’ll learn, innovate, and continue to deliver on our promise to bring the joy and community of gaming to more people. We’ll do this in a culture that strives to empower everyone to do their best work, where all people are welcome, and is centered on our ongoing commitment of Gaming for Everyone. We are intentional about inclusion in everything we do at Xbox – from our team to the products we make and the stories we tell, to the way our players interact and engage as a wider gaming community. Together, we’ll create new worlds and stories, bring your favorite games to more places so more players can join in, and we’ll engage with and delight players in new, innovative ways in the places they love to play including mobile, cloud streaming and more. Players have always been at the center of everything we do. And as we grow, we’ll continue to keep players at the heart of it all. We’ll continue to listen to your feedback, build a community where you can be yourself, where developers can do their best work, and continue to make really fun games. As promised, we will also continue to make more games available in more places – and that begins now by enabling cloud streaming providers and players to stream Activision Blizzard games in the European Economic Area, a commitment made to the European Commission. Today we start the work to bring beloved Activision, Blizzard, and King franchises to Game Pass and other platforms. We’ll share more about when you can expect to play in the coming months. We know you’re excited – and we are too. For the millions of fans who love Activision, Blizzard, and King games, we want you to know that today is a good day to play. You are the heart and soul of these franchises, and we are honored to have you as part of our community. Whether you play on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC or mobile, you are welcome here – and will remain welcome, even if Xbox isn’t where you play your favorite franchise. Because when everyone plays, we all win. We believe our news today will unlock a world of possibilities for more ways to play. Thank you for the ongoing support. We have so much more to come in the months ahead – I’m excited for the future and cannot wait to share it with you.","length":8207,"tokens":1695,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Microsoft Officially Acquires Activision Blizzard, Nearly Two Years Later","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 9:58AM PDT","content":"Microsoft has officially closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, marking Microsoft's biggest acquisition of all time and one of the largest in the history of the business world across all sectors.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix has obtained the rights to both the previously aired Season 1 and has committed to airing the upcoming Season 2 once its production has concluded. Star Trek: Prodigy \"follows a group of lawless teens who discover a derelict Starfleet ship and use it to search for adventure, meaning and salvation.\" Season 1 is set to be available for streaming later this year, with Season 2 scheduled for release in 2024. In June, Paramount+ abruptly canceled Prodigy, taking advantage of tax write-offs. This move was unexpected, given that the series was produced in-house by CBS Studios. Additionally, Star Trek had been positioned as a key component of the streaming service since its CBS All Access days, driven by filmmaker Alex Kurtzman's (creator of Star Trek: Discovery, Short Trek, Picard, and Strange New Worlds) vision to expand the universe and connect with a new generation of Trek fans. News broke of Prodigy finding its new home on Netflix following a GoFundMe campaign launched by the series' fans. The campaign, which raised about $1,500 from 46 donations towards a $1,200 goal, led to a skywriting plane flying over the offices of multiple streaming services, including Netflix, in August. This initiative came after the creation of a petition that stands at over 33,000 signatures.\"Thank you to our incredible Star Trek: Prodigy fans, who championed not just a show, but a community that's always been connected by the belief that we build a better future together,\" said Kurtzman and co-showrunners Dan and Kevin Hageman in a statement. \"We set out to inspire you, but you inspired us.

The FTC said Microsoft's deal with Ubisoft to sell its cloud gaming rights \"presents a whole new fact to the merger\" that could affect American consumers. The FTC spokesperson said it will assess this as part of its ongoing appeals process.\"The FTC continues to believe this deal is a threat to competition,\" the group said. Microsoft sold the cloud gaming rights to Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft to help convince regulators in the UK to clear the deal. As part of this agreement, Ubisoft gets the rights to existing Activision Blizzard games and all future games in the next 15 years in perpetuity. Microsoft was always expected to go forward with closing its deal for Activision Blizzard amid the FTC appeal. As the FTC stated, it will argue its case in federal appeals court on December 6. Microsoft now owns Activision Blizzard and all of its franchises, including Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.

Microsoft was always expected to go forward with closing its deal for Activision Blizzard amid the FTC appeal. As the FTC stated, it will argue its case in federal appeals court on December 6.

It’s a circular-shaped device that lays flat on a surface with eight radial buttons, one large button at the center, and an analog stick protruding outward. A profile button lets you cycle between three different control schemes that you can customize in the system settings, and the home button is found on the base of the analog stick. Additionally, there are four 3.5mm ports on the side that will recognize any third-party input device, letting you use existing accessibility tools as additional buttons. What’s more is that the PlayStation Access controller was made with modularity in mind, meaning you can physically customize it to suit your needs. All eight buttons along the edges have magnetic caps that can be popped out and swapped for different-shaped caps that come packaged with the controller. These offer varying styles of tactility on a per-button basis to either help distinguish one button from another, or make pressing them down easier. Additionally, the package includes bigger caps that cover two inputs simultaneously--and since you can set two inputs to be recognized as the same button in the system settings, this gives you more surface area to press one button if you need it. As for the analog stick, it’s able to slide outward or toward the controller itself, allowing you to set the distance between them. A total of three different stick caps are packed in as well--one similar to the DualSense stick, a slightly larger convex-shaped cap, and a bigger arcade stick-style ball. Another helpful feature in the system settings is that you can have the console recognize the default orientation of stick inputs from any of the four cardinal directions. For example, if I prefer to have the stick to the right or left of the controller, or above or below it, the system and games will adjust directional inputs accordingly. Customizing the Access controller during the preview event at PlayStation's US headquarters. Support Through SoftwareOne of the several facets that make the Playstation Access controller viable is the built-in software support on the PS5 operating system. Once you connect the controller as you would the DualSense, you get full button customization in the options menu when selecting the controller from the PS5 dashboard. Each input is bindable to any of the DualSense buttons. It's why all of the radial buttons are labeled one through eight rather than being predetermined for you--and the package comes with interchangeable tabs with the button icons so you can match the inputs to however you customize your control scheme. What's more is that you can set a single input to register two different button presses. For example, activating Spartan Rage in God of War requires pressing L3 and R3 together, and with the PlayStation Access controller, both inputs can be set to a single button. Another option is the button-press toggle mode. Toggle can be set to individual buttons, and what this does is tell the PS5 you're effectively holding down that button with only having to press it once--then you toggle off by pressing the button again. If you have trouble keeping pressure onto a button to hold, this feature is extremely helpful. The best example of this was playing Gran Turismo 7 and setting the accelerate button to toggle mode, activating and deactivating throughout the race to control my car's speed. Additionally, I was able to get hands-on time with the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit (sold separately), which is a set of external buttons you can plug into the PlayStation Access controller's four 3.5mm ports. This was particularly useful in Horizon Forbidden West, which has a fairly complex control scheme and a ton of different commands that are required at different points in the game. The PS5 operating system automatically recognizes these inputs when plugged in so it's very simple to get setup. But if you don't want to or can't spend extra money on third-party devices, the PS5 lets you pair a DualSense in tandem with the Access controller to essentially act as another half of the same controller. It might not be the most ideal setup for some, but it is the most cost effective given that every PS5 owner has a DualSense already. Setting button input bindings for the PlayStation Access controller through the dashboard. Designing Access Alongside Disabled GamersAlvin Daniel spoke in depth about the design philosophy and development process of the PlayStation Access controller, and one of the many things he mentioned was making sure it could function as a complete product right out of the box. Able Gamers founder and executive director Mark Barlet, who consulted on the Access controller, stressed the importance of this saying, \"Everything you need is in the box without customizing anything, you're rocking and rolling. But in 20 minutes, you can get some new buttons in there.\"It's a different approach compared to the Xbox Adaptive controller, which is more like a hub for external input devices to be plugged into rather than being a controller with a set form factor for most of your buttons. But that presented different types of challenges. \"We were given a blank slate, then thought, 'How do we craft a controller that would be broadly impactful to as many players as possible?'\" Daniel shared during the conversation. Admittedly, there will never be a one-size-fits-all solution for accessibility controllers because as Daniel recognizes, everyone experiences different disabilities to varying degrees and with different challenges. But through ethnographic testing early in the process, sending out prototypes early during the pandemic, the team eventually arrived at the design we see today. That's where Barlet came in with Able Gamers. Barlet advised PlayStation on design iterations to accommodate various disabilities, as well as helped the company get early versions of the controller to the right people and collect feedback. \"If there's someone with multiple sclerosis, [there's also] someone who has a visual impairment, auditory impairment, or other physical impairments. It's that philosophy of exploiting movement that works for someone and giving them a controller that lets them find the part they're really good at moving and be able to use those inputs,\" Barlet mentioned.<img alt=\"A closer look at the four 3.5mm inputs for additional buttons, the USB-C charging port, and the latch on button caps to pop them out for customization.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4204640-img_4556. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4204640-img_4556. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4204640-img_4556. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4204640-img_4556. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">A closer look at the four 3.5mm inputs for additional buttons, the USB-C charging port, and the latch on button caps to pop them out for customization. Paul Lane and Cesar Flores, both of whom consulted on the Access controller, mentioned a similar philosophy. While they have their own disabilities, Lane said, \"Whenever we consult and work on a project, we don't just think about ourselves. If something works for Cesar, we always [consider] a person who has a more severe disability. Because sometimes what happens is, when we work as consultants, there's a focus on what works for us, but the [PlayStation] team is always open to when we say, 'This will help me but my friend who has to use a fight stick for example, [something else] can help them.'\"Lane and Flores are both quadriplegic and lack feeling in parts of their hands, so Lane highlighted that auditory feedback on button presses was extremely important. It's things outside of the controller itself that matter to him, too. For example, making it easy for non-gamer caregivers to set up for others and designing the physical customization to be intuitive with features like the magnetic button caps. He also brought up affordability as a key aspect PlayStation was receptive to (which resulted in the $90 price point) saying, \"Many of us are ballin' on a budget. Disabled [people] often rely on Social Security and don't have a lot of income.\"The PlayStation Access controller is also intentionally designed to be a bespoke controller that exists on equal ground alongside the rest of the platform's gamepads. This was paramount for Flores, who mentioned that a lot of equipment made to assist disabled people looks and feels \"medical,\" implying there's a sterile, impersonal nature to those devices. With the Access controller, \"It really makes me feel like I'm just going to game, my disability doesn't matter anymore. [Gaming] is a part of me, but it's also this thing that allows me to feel like I'm just back to myself,\" Flores said. Having the Access controller look and function like a proper PlayStation product is also important because as he concluded, \"When you have a disability, you don’t want to be reminded you have a disability, especially while gaming.\"<img alt=\"A full look at what comes in the package with the PlayStation Access controller.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4204521-accesscontrolller_02_beauty_srgb. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4204521-accesscontrolller_02_beauty_srgb. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4204521-accesscontrolller_02_beauty_srgb. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4204521-accesscontrolller_02_beauty_srgb. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">A full look at what comes in the package with the PlayStation Access controller. The Broader PictureWith years of iteration and consultation with a range of disabled gamers, the PlayStation Access controller leaves the impression that it is the right piece of hardware to round out the ecosystem, helping the PS5 be an accessible platform for as wide an audience as possible. That said, the controller alone wouldn't be fully effective if the system itself isn't designed to support all of its capabilities. And the gameplay experience isn't going to fully translate if the games themselves don't include options to accommodate various needs. But when all those elements are working together, it's special to see in action. My hands-on experience was eye-opening and humbling, and highlighted the importance of accessibility and how it's a multifaceted endeavor to get right. I saw first-hand how games with robust accessibility options can synergize with a device like the PlayStation Access controller to open up games to so many more people who wouldn't be able to experience them otherwise--and on top of that, make those games feel like they are tailored for audiences regardless of what accommodations they may need. While the preview offered what is more or less the final product, the PlayStation Access controller won't be available until December 6 this year (although preorders are currently open ). It will retail for $90 USD and will only be compatible with the PlayStation 5.","length":14394,"tokens":3195,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The PlayStation Access Controller Is Setting Up An Accessibility Revolution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"The PlayStation Access controller has been five years in the making, a first-party device created for as wide a range of disabled players as possible.

Another option is the button-press toggle mode.","content_length":949,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The PlayStation Access Controller Is Setting Up An Accessibility Revolution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"Toggle can be set to individual buttons, and what this does is tell the PS5 you're effectively holding down that button with only having to press it once--then you toggle off by pressing the button again. If you have trouble keeping pressure onto a button to hold, this feature is extremely helpful. The best example of this was playing Gran Turismo 7 and setting the accelerate button to toggle mode, activating and deactivating throughout the race to control my car's speed. Additionally, I was able to get hands-on time with the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit (sold separately), which is a set of external buttons you can plug into the PlayStation Access controller's four 3.5mm ports. This was particularly useful in Horizon Forbidden West, which has a fairly complex control scheme and a ton of different commands that are required at different points in the game. The PS5 operating system automatically recognizes these inputs when plugged in so it's very simple to get setup.","content_length":982,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The PlayStation Access Controller Is Setting Up An Accessibility Revolution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"But if you don't want to or can't spend extra money on third-party devices, the PS5 lets you pair a DualSense in tandem with the Access controller to essentially act as another half of the same controller.

Setting button input bindings for the PlayStation Access controller through the dashboard. Designing Access Alongside Disabled GamersAlvin Daniel spoke in depth about the design philosophy and development process of the PlayStation Access controller, and one of the many things he mentioned was making sure it could function as a complete product right out of the box. Able Gamers founder and executive director Mark Barlet, who consulted on the Access controller, stressed the importance of this saying, \"Everything you need is in the box without customizing anything, you're rocking and rolling.","content_length":936,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The PlayStation Access Controller Is Setting Up An Accessibility Revolution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"But in 20 minutes, you can get some new buttons in there.\"It's a different approach compared to the Xbox Adaptive controller, which is more like a hub for external input devices to be plugged into rather than being a controller with a set form factor for most of your buttons. But that presented different types of challenges. \"We were given a blank slate, then thought, 'How do we craft a controller that would be broadly impactful to as many players as possible?'\" Daniel shared during the conversation. Admittedly, there will never be a one-size-fits-all solution for accessibility controllers because as Daniel recognizes, everyone experiences different disabilities to varying degrees and with different challenges. But through ethnographic testing early in the process, sending out prototypes early during the pandemic, the team eventually arrived at the design we see today.

My hands-on experience was eye-opening and humbling, and highlighted the importance of accessibility and how it's a multifaceted endeavor to get right.

Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management.

Covered employees will be able to easily exercise their right to communicate with other employees and union representatives about union membership in a way that encourages information sharing and avoids business disruptions. Employees will have access to an innovative technology-supported and streamlined process for choosing whether to join a union. Employees can maintain confidentiality and privacy of that choice if they wish. If a disagreement arises between CWA and Microsoft under the agreement, the two organizations will work together promptly to reach an agreement and will turn to an expedited arbitration process if they cannot. Microsoft has shown evidence that it will back up its talk with action--or non-action, as it were--when members of Bethesda's QA staff announced an intention to unionize back in December.

Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management. Microsoft’s high-road approach should be the norm across the industry.\"The official terms of the agreement, per the CWA, are as follows:Microsoft will maintain neutrality when employees covered by the agreement express interest in joining a union. Covered employees will be able to easily exercise their right to communicate with other employees and union representatives about union membership in a way that encourages information sharing and avoids business disruptions. Employees will have access to an innovative technology-supported and streamlined process for choosing whether to join a union. Employees can maintain confidentiality and privacy of that choice if they wish. If a disagreement arises between CWA and Microsoft under the agreement, the two organizations will work together promptly to reach an agreement and will turn to an expedited arbitration process if they cannot.","content_length":1109,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Major Union Calls Completion Of Xbox/Activision Merger \"A New Day\" For Workers","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-union-calls-completion-of-xbox-activision-merger-a-new-day-for-workers/1100-6518388/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 8:10AM PDT","content":"Microsoft has shown evidence that it will back up its talk with action--or non-action, as it were--when members of Bethesda's QA staff announced an intention to unionize back in December.

One of the biggest drawbacks to the headset is its price--clocking in at $600, it’s not exactly cheap. However, Dell is offering a free $100 gift card with your purchase right now, making it a bit more affordable to add PSVR 2 to your game room. PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $600 Your purchase includes not just the PSVR 2 headset, but also Horizon Call of the Mountain and additional accessories (such as the PSVR 2 Sense controller, stereo headphones, and three pairs of earpieces). The main attraction is the $100 Dell eGift Card, which can be used towards the purchase of anything in the Dell catalog--including PS5 games, laptops, monitors, or other electronics. See at Dell Considering PSVR 2 has rarely seen a price cut since launching in February, this offer is arguably one of the better deals we’ve seen for the headset. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also one of the best games available on the device, as it uses unique climbing and combat mechanics to tell the story of Ryas, a member of the Shadow Carja who breaks out of prison and tries to unravel a new mystery about the machines inhabiting their world. Our Horizon Call of the Mountain review gave it a 7 out of 10, knocking it for being less innovative than expected, but praising it for great visuals and characters. It’s a similar story for the PSVR 2 headset, which our PSVR 2 review found to have a “high-quality build and premium feel,” but is still looking for a game that makes full use of its potential. It’s unclear how much longer this Dell deal will stick around, so be sure to check it out while you can.

Looking ahead, the company will also offer an Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Collector's Edition, which comes with a Na'vi statue and artbook. So Ubisoft is clearly putting money where its mouth is to back up Early's statements. The streaming service Ubisoft+ became available on Xbox in April, but it does require an $18 monthly Multi Access subscription. It is not included in Game Pass Ultimate like EA Play.

Authenticity is at the heart of Analogue's approach to offering an improved gaming experience that gels with modern technology. Aesthetically, Analogue hardware tends to pay homage to the original with sleek, understated designs. The Super Nt (SNES) and Mega Sg (Genesis) are prime examples of this, as were the black and white launch models of the Analogue Pocket, the manufacturer's first handheld. With the special-edition Pocket Glow, Analogue has leaned into the quirkiness and memorability of the Game Boy era from a design perspective. As you'll see below, we would be lucky to get more gaming hardware that looks this cool. The Pocket Glow shines before it actually shines. The shell's pale green hue stands out and, based on my limited time with it so far, hides fingerprints and smudges better than the original black model (and most other modern handhelds). It's an eye-catching device that captures that similar magic and originality that marked the Nintendo of the late '90s and early aughts. Analogue developed a proprietary plastic that it says can glow in the dark for roughly eight hours and \"charges\" via both natural and artificial light. That number sounds about right, as I sometimes noticed it maintained its glow in the morning.

What's especially cool is that the Pocket's glowing effect isn't all or nothing. As demonstrated in the slideshow above, each spot glows separately, creating a shimmering effect that's stunning. Though this effect dissipates in a matter of minutes, it's a neat flourish that would've wowed the neighbor kid and made him as envious as I was when he showed off his translucent Nintendo 64. Game systems nowadays mostly try to blend in with our entertainment center, using a color palette largely consisting of black, white, and a splash of gray or silver.

Well, technically you could have, provided you placed your $250 order prior to it selling out approximately one minute after it became available (seriously). The same thing happened when the seven(!) different translucent Pockets went up for preorder last month.

If you're sitting there thinking that Sony has been in the gaming space for a long time via PlayStation, you're technically correct. But the Inzone line of headsets (and monitors), though compatible with PS5, are geared toward PC gamers and take cues from Sony's leading audio gear, such as the flagship WH-1000XM5 headphones. The original trio of Inzone gaming headsets marked an impressive foray into the overpopulated gaming headset market. Now, Sony is entering a far less crowded arena with the latest edition to the lineup: Inzone Buds. Considering the broad popularity of earbuds such as AirPods, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Sony's wide range of styles, it's somewhat surprising that the gaming earbud market is quite slim. There have been a few releases from major gaming companies, including Razer's Hammerhead, HyperX's Cloud Mix, and Asus' ROG Cetra, but none have gained the reputation of flagship offerings from their respective brands. So, Sony is entering largely uncharted waters with the release of its $200 Inzone Buds on October 15. Sony Inzone Buds $200 Preorder at Amazon (white) Preorder at Amazon (black) To its benefit, Sony has extensive experience in the general wireless earbuds department. As such, Sony has integrated the quality audio tech from its earbuds and headphones into the Inzone Buds. Based on my early impressions, Sony's Inzone Buds stack up well against some of the high-end gaming headsets I've tested. If you find headsets uncomfortable or simply prefer earbuds, the Inzone Buds are certainly worth considering if you game on PC or PS5. Side note: PlayStation is releasing its own pair of gaming earbuds called Pulse Explore, which retail for the same $200 price as the Inzone Buds. These are designed for the PlayStation Portal, though will be compatible with PS5 and PC with a separate adapter. Sony's Inzone Buds are available in a black or white/black color scheme. Inzone Buds are a tad bulkier than a lot of popular earbuds, including other models from Sony. Once you place them in your ears, you twist backward slightly to get them in a snug position. I'm someone who has long had issues getting earbuds to stay in (maybe my ears are weird?), but that hasn't happened with these. And despite the larger-than-average footprint, the Inzone Buds are extremely lightweight, so they aren't uncomfortable over long stretches. With four different earcup tip sizes in the box, you should be able to a fit that works well. Given how great Sony's active noise cancellation tech is in its audio products, it's not surprising ANC is a highlight here. It's comparable to Turtle Beach's Stealth Pro and SteelSeries' Arctis Nova Pro, the two gaming headsets I've tried that have the best ANC. If you also need to hear outside noises for whatever reason, the ambient sound mode works great, too. I left the earbuds in while sitting next to my toddler and mostly understood what he was babbling about (misunderstood words not caused by the earbuds). Just as Sony included features from its conventional headphones when designing the Inzone headsets--the high-end Inzone H9 has the plush leatherette earcups found in the WH-1000XM5 headphones--the Inzone Buds borrow the 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X from Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 earbuds. It's not surprising the Inzone Buds sound great, as you're getting audio drivers found in a pair of $300 earbuds. The included charging case doubles the battery life. This fact alone might make you wonder if you should ditch your regular earbuds for the Inzone Buds. That won't be possible for many prospective buyers. The Inzone Buds support Bluetooth 5.3 (LE), not the usual 5 or 5.1 found in most electronics. As a result, you can only use them as traditional Bluetooth earbuds with a small number of newer Android phones for now--iPhones don't support Bluetooth LE. Your primary wireless transmission is via the USB-C dongle, which has a toggle: one side for PC, the other for PS5 and mobile. Most mobile users will have to rely on this for mobile support, provided you don't mind having a small transmitter poking out of your phone's charging port. And depending on what your phone case looks like, you might not even be able to connect the dongle without removing it. In short, the Inzone Buds won't replace your Bluetooth earbuds, which is disappointing considering they are plenty good enough from a sound and comfort standpoint to double as mobile earbuds for listening to music and podcasts. For the purpose of gaming, however, connecting to your PC via a 2.4GHz USB-C dongle makes total sense. If you're one of those PC gamers who swears by wired headsets, you should know that latency is practically nonexistent. Technically, it's 30 milliseconds, but I haven't noticed a difference between my wired headsets and the Inzone Buds. The Buds also stand up well to gaming headsets when it comes to chat. Sony used AI noise-reduction technology to eliminate outside noise such as clattering keyboards, mouse clicks, fans, and other sounds that can muffle your voice. Like other gaming headset manufacturers, Sony has proprietary software for customizing your audio experience, including enabling 360 Spatial Sound for PC (PS5 users get PlayStation's Tempest 3D Audio). This tech remains one of the best features of the Inzone line, as it measures your ears (with a mobile app) to create a custom sound profile. In effect, 360 Spatial Sound delivers audio that you can pinpoint more accurately (direction and distance). The Windows-only Inzone Hub is also where you can make changes to equalizer and sound profile. All of the adjustments save to the Buds, so you can retain your sound profile on PS5 or mobile device--you just can't tinker with it outside of the PC app. The tap controls on the Buds' touch sensors can be modified to different functions inside the Inzone app, too. On a full charge, you can get up to 12 hours of runtime when synced to the USB-C dongle. Over Bluetooth LE, Sony says to expect up to 24 hours of battery life, though I wasn't able to test this. The huge discrepancy in these numbers is related to the perk of Bluetooth Low Energy: to consume less power. The charging case doubles both of those figures, and if you run out of juice while gaming, the Buds can get an hour of runtime from only five minutes of charging.<img alt=\"Sony Inzone H5 gaming headset\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5. png 1000w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5. png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-width=\"1000\">Sony Inzone H5 gaming headsetIn addition to the Inzone Buds, Sony is introducing the Inzone H5, a new over-ear headset that's replacing the Inzone H7. The H7 retailed for $230, which made it difficult to recommend as there are plenty of comparable mid-range headsets for significantly less. The H5, on the other hand, costs $150, a far more reasonable price for a headset in its range. It's largely the same headset, save for a few key differences. Sony added the aforementioned AI noise-reduction tech to the microphone, and the H5 is noticeably lighter at 260 grams (the H7 is 325 grams). The H5 drops Bluetooth support and adds a 3.5mm headphone jack--that's either good or bad, depending on your preferences. Both of the new additions to the Inzone lineup are available in a white/black color scheme or all-black. A new all-black version of the high-end Inzone H9 also launches on October 15 alongside the Inzone Buds and Inzone H5.

I'm someone who has long had issues getting earbuds to stay in (maybe my ears are weird?), but that hasn't happened with these. And despite the larger-than-average footprint, the Inzone Buds are extremely lightweight, so they aren't uncomfortable over long stretches. With four different earcup tip sizes in the box, you should be able to a fit that works well.","content_length":883,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"Given how great Sony's active noise cancellation tech is in its audio products, it's not surprising ANC is a highlight here. It's comparable to Turtle Beach's Stealth Pro and SteelSeries' Arctis Nova Pro, the two gaming headsets I've tried that have the best ANC. If you also need to hear outside noises for whatever reason, the ambient sound mode works great, too. I left the earbuds in while sitting next to my toddler and mostly understood what he was babbling about (misunderstood words not caused by the earbuds) Just as Sony included features from its conventional headphones when designing the Inzone headsets--the high-end Inzone H9 has the plush leatherette earcups found in the WH-1000XM5 headphones--the Inzone Buds borrow the 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X from Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 earbuds.","content_length":801,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"It's not surprising the Inzone Buds sound great, as you're getting audio drivers found in a pair of $300 earbuds. The included charging case doubles the battery life. This fact alone might make you wonder if you should ditch your regular earbuds for the Inzone Buds. That won't be possible for many prospective buyers. The Inzone Buds support Bluetooth 5.3 (LE), not the usual 5 or 5.1 found in most electronics. As a result, you can only use them as traditional Bluetooth earbuds with a small number of newer Android phones for now--iPhones don't support Bluetooth LE. Your primary wireless transmission is via the USB-C dongle, which has a toggle: one side for PC, the other for PS5 and mobile. Most mobile users will have to rely on this for mobile support, provided you don't mind having a small transmitter poking out of your phone's charging port.","content_length":853,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"And depending on what your phone case looks like, you might not even be able to connect the dongle without removing it. In short, the Inzone Buds won't replace your Bluetooth earbuds, which is disappointing considering they are plenty good enough from a sound and comfort standpoint to double as mobile earbuds for listening to music and podcasts. For the purpose of gaming, however, connecting to your PC via a 2.4GHz USB-C dongle makes total sense. If you're one of those PC gamers who swears by wired headsets, you should know that latency is practically nonexistent. Technically, it's 30 milliseconds, but I haven't noticed a difference between my wired headsets and the Inzone Buds. The Buds also stand up well to gaming headsets when it comes to chat. Sony used AI noise-reduction technology to eliminate outside noise such as clattering keyboards, mouse clicks, fans, and other sounds that can muffle your voice.","content_length":919,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"Like other gaming headset manufacturers, Sony has proprietary software for customizing your audio experience, including enabling 360 Spatial Sound for PC (PS5 users get PlayStation's Tempest 3D Audio) This tech remains one of the best features of the Inzone line, as it measures your ears (with a mobile app) to create a custom sound profile. In effect, 360 Spatial Sound delivers audio that you can pinpoint more accurately (direction and distance) The Windows-only Inzone Hub is also where you can make changes to equalizer and sound profile. All of the adjustments save to the Buds, so you can retain your sound profile on PS5 or mobile device--you just can't tinker with it outside of the PC app. The tap controls on the Buds' touch sensors can be modified to different functions inside the Inzone app, too. On a full charge, you can get up to 12 hours of runtime when synced to the USB-C dongle.","content_length":900,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"Over Bluetooth LE, Sony says to expect up to 24 hours of battery life, though I wasn't able to test this. The huge discrepancy in these numbers is related to the perk of Bluetooth Low Energy: to consume less power. The charging case doubles both of those figures, and if you run out of juice while gaming, the Buds can get an hour of runtime from only five minutes of charging.<img alt=\"Sony Inzone H5 gaming headset\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5. png 1000w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4204905-inzoneh5.","content_length":684,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sony's New Inzone Buds Aim To Replace Your Gaming Headset","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-inzone-buds-aim-to-replace-your-gaming-headset/1100-6518375/","post_date":"October 13, 2023 at 6:35AM PDT","content":"png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-width=\"1000\">Sony Inzone H5 gaming headsetIn addition to the Inzone Buds, Sony is introducing the Inzone H5, a new over-ear headset that's replacing the Inzone H7. The H7 retailed for $230, which made it difficult to recommend as there are plenty of comparable mid-range headsets for significantly less. The H5, on the other hand, costs $150, a far more reasonable price for a headset in its range. It's largely the same headset, save for a few key differences. Sony added the aforementioned AI noise-reduction tech to the microphone, and the H5 is noticeably lighter at 260 grams (the H7 is 325 grams) The H5 drops Bluetooth support and adds a 3.5mm headphone jack--that's either good or bad, depending on your preferences. Both of the new additions to the Inzone lineup are available in a white/black color scheme or all-black. A new all-black version of the high-end Inzone H9 also launches on October 15 alongside the Inzone Buds and Inzone H5.

Movie and Sonic the Hedgehog were cleaning up at the box office, Resident Evil and Final Fantasy were raising the bar for video game movies. Sure, said bar may not have been raised much--or at all in some cases--but at least these films weren't a repeat of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.

Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a groundbreaking movie at the time of its release, an astonishing showcase of computer-generated animation that was unlike anything else seen at the time. At its core, the film is also an underrated tale of death and grief, mixed with sci-fi action and a stirring score. Then there's Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, a direct sequel to Final Fantasy VII that follows Cloud and his crew as they investigate a strange blight that has spread across Midgar. As if an apocalyptic plague wasn't bad enough, remnants of Sephiroth's spirit have manifested and are working toward resurrecting the infamous villain by using the extraterrestrial remains of Jenova. Yes, it's weird, but at least there's a banger of a showdown near the end capped off by incredible action and guitar solos. It's worth noting that this is also the \"complete\" cut of Advent Children that contains 26 minutes of additional footage and over 1,000 revised scenes, all remastered in 4K. Lastly, Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is an action-packed film that's an essential part of the game. The events in this movie were briefly referenced in Final Fantasy XV, as the tale of Nyx and his fellow soldiers rallying to stop the Niflheim invasion of Lucis is visually impressive and explosive in its execution. On the Resident Evil side, fans of the Capcom survival-horror series are in for a treat. Damnation, Degeneration, and Vendetta have all been bundled into one gory collection, and while these films weren't designed to win several Annie awards, they're still fun dives into the world of biological warfare. There are a few mem-worthy moments between them, and they make for some fun viewing on a cold night. Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness is a solid mini-series set between the events of the fourth and fifth games in the mainline series, focusing on Leon Kennedy as he defends the White House from a zombie outbreak--top that, Gerard Butler--while Claire Redfield works on her own investigation. Lastly, the recent release of Resident Evil: Death Island is already substantially discounted and is basically the Avengers of the animated film series. Leon Kennedy, Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Claire Redfield, and Rebeccah Chambers all appear in the film, eventually leading to a giant showdown on Alcatraz Island between the Resident Evil heroes and a mysterious antagonist.

As you explore the game's various locations, you'll likely find that your attempts to pick up some items results in a giant Umbral enemy tearing through the fabric of reality to gobble you up and spit you out. This can often result in an instant death, so you'll want to learn how to spot this tricky foe from afar. We'll tell you how below. How to spot mimic items in Lords of the FallenMimic items are scattered all through Lords of the Fallen, often even sitting among other normal items just waiting for you to pick it up and have a chunk taken out of your health bar. Luckily, you can spot this mimicry by watching the little tail that extends above the item. If it stays relatively still and only sways slightly, it's a safe item to pick up. However, if you notice that the item's tail looks as if it's being blown around by a breeze every few seconds, you've found yourself a mimic item. Avoid it at all costs. Notice how it's blowing about? You don't want to touch this one. That's not where the trickery ends, though. Even once you've spotted a mimic item and left it behind, the Umbral monster will often move the location of the item around to try to throw you off your next time through. While it'll always be in the same general area, just be sure not to get complacent--treachery is afoot. It may be a little frustrating to have to stop and look at each item before picking it up, but given the frequency of mimic items in Lords of the Fallen, it's in your best interest.

Defeat the various enemies that litter this room and then continue forward through the cavern until you reach outside again. You'll need to hop to the hanging pallet to the left here, then jump once more to the other side. Note that if you're in the Umbral Realm, you can turn around here and use your lamp to create a walkway back across. Run forward down the long walkway and face off against the tough spiked helmet-wearing foe at the end, then take the ladder down. Afterward, be sure to enter the Umbral Realm, as you won't be able to continue in Axiom. Once you're in Umbral, take the next ladder down into an open area filled with baddies. You can fight them if you'd like, or you can just run to the other side of the area and go up the ladder next to the final pillar here. At the top, wrap around and take one more ladder up, then cross over the thin walkway here and defeat the enemy on the other side. Don't bother using the effigy here to switch back to Axiom--you'll need to remain in Umbral to reach your destination anyways. Head down to the next walkway and continue forward defeating enemies as you go. At the end, there's another ladder that will lead you to two of those spiked helmet-wearing enemies, which can result in quite a tough fight early in the game. If possible, aggro them and then take the ladder back up use ranged magic or throwables to lower their health before engaging. This door can only be soulflayed once you've removed the Umbral entity blocking the way. When the enemies are dead, you'll find that an Umbral entity is blocking your path, meaning you'll need to find and soulflay some spots around the area while in the Umbral Realm. Here's where to find them. The first spot is above and to the right of Umbral entity. The second spot is to the left of the Umbral entity after crossing a thin walkway. The third spot is below the door, accessed by following a pathway on the opposite side of the platform. At the end of this area, right after soulflaying another spot for the Book of Sin, peer over the edge to find this last soulflay spot. With all of the Umbral entity removed, you can now soulflay the spot where it was to open an entrance. Go through it and then descend a few ladders. When you reach the bottom of the second, you'll be able to hear Gerlinde fussing about below, but before you head down to rescue her, be sure to step on the nearby elevator to take you back up to the Bellroom vestige. This shortcut comes in handy, as there's a boss further through this area, too. Thanks for the key, big guy. When you're ready, go back down the elevator and take one final ladder down to the very bottom of this area to face off against multiple dogs and a shield-wielding elite enemy. When defeated, the big boy will drop a Prison Cell Key, which you can then give to Gerlinde in the nearby cage. Once you rest at a vestige again, Gerlinde will relocate to Skyrest. You can find her up the left set of stairs near the vestige there where she'll now allow you to upgrade your weapons for a price, as well as offer you other services, like a shop and (eventually) the ability to slot runes.

At the end of this area, right after soulflaying another spot for the Book of Sin, peer over the edge to find this last soulflay spot. With all of the Umbral entity removed, you can now soulflay the spot where it was to open an entrance. Go through it and then descend a few ladders.

When defeated, the big boy will drop a Prison Cell Key, which you can then give to Gerlinde in the nearby cage. Once you rest at a vestige again, Gerlinde will relocate to Skyrest. You can find her up the left set of stairs near the vestige there where she'll now allow you to upgrade your weapons for a price, as well as offer you other services, like a shop and (eventually) the ability to slot runes.

As a Lampbearer, you walk the planes of the living and the dead, the Axiom realm and the Umbral realm, all to prevent the rise of the demon lord Adyr. Naturally, you might be wondering how long it takes to beat Lords of the Fallen. Well, we've got you covered in our campaign length guide. How long does it take to beat Lords of the FallenIt takes roughly 35 to 45 hours to complete the campaign in Lords of the Fallen. Bear in mind that several factors come into play. The most important facet is that this is a Soulslike game, which means a degree of difficulty is expected. Those who are already familiar with the genre know what to expect, but newcomers might need a bit more time to learn the ropes. Potential challenges include:Combat mechanics, such as perfect parries, iframe dodges, and grievous blows that you need to master. Tough boss fights that are punishing if you make crucial mistakes. Endless waves of enemies in the Umbral Realm, along with those that are still in the Axiom Realm. Take note that you essentially have two lives. If you die in the Axiom Realm, you'll be transported to the Umbral Realm, so you have another shot at defeating your foes. However, if you die in the Umbral Realm, you'll respawn at your last used waypoint and you need to do a \"corpse run\" just to retrieve your lost Vigor (i. e. souls/XP). If you die along the way, your Vigor will be gone for good. Moreover, you'll leave your Vigor in a boss' arena if you perish against a boss, which means your only recourse is to vanquish your opponent. You'll travel from dimly lit caverns to fetid swamps, and every imaginable environment in between. Other factors that may affect completion timeThe main goal in Lords of the Fallen is to cleanse the five beacons to stop the reemergence of the demon god Adyr. Your journey then leads to various zones, from snowfields and swamplands to burning cities and the realm of spirits, all to finish your objective. There are also other factors that can affect how long it takes to beat Lords of the Fallen:Waypoint/bonfire placements - The locations of bonfires in the game can sometimes be iffy. There are also temporary waypoints called Seedlings that require you to use a consumable item. As such, you could find yourself respawned in a faraway area if your character dies, assuming you didn't tag a waypoint along the way. No traditional map - Most Soulslike games are intentionally vague when it comes to directions, but Lords of the Fallen takes it up a notch. There's no traditional map, and there's no inkling as to where you need to go when you explore labyrinthine locations. As such, you might feel lost, or you'd end up in a zone with tougher foes. For instance, the Pilgrim's Perch Key unlocks a pathway that leads to two zones that have beacons. Secret classes and multiple endings - Lords of the Fallen has three unique endings that you can unlock based on the decisions that you make throughout the campaign. These, too, lead to three additional starting classes. There's also a fourth class, which is part of an easy-to-miss questline. You can learn more in our Radiant Ending/Radiant Purifier class guide and Umbral Ending/Putrid Child class guide. New Game Plus and extra runs - Well past your first run, you can opt for another go by selecting New Game Plus, which lets you keep most of your items, though it also ramps up the difficulty. Pray that there's a vestige waypoint/bonfire nearby in case your character perishes. That's it: that's everything you need to know about how long it takes to beat Lords of the Fallen.

While Sombra is still a stealth-focused flanker, it now requires a bit more thought to get in and out of trouble.

Sombra is designed to be a flanker and a disruptor. Stealth is now a passive ability, with Sombra entering stealth after being out of combat for two seconds. The translocator now functions as a short range teleport, with Sombra throwing it and teleporting shortly after. To best utilize Sombra, you want to sneak up on an enemy, Hack them, hit them with the Virus, and shoot them, before throwing the Translocator to escape the area. Sombra abilities Machine Pistol: Short-ranged automatic weapon. Hack: Hold to hack. Hacked enemies cannot use abilities for a few seconds and can be seen through walls. Hacked health packs respawn faster and cannot be picked up by the enemy team. Taking damage interrupts the hack attempt. Stealth: Become invisible and move faster. Translocator: Throw a beacon and teleport to it automatically after 0.25 seconds. Reduces Stealth passive cooldown. EMP ultimate: Deals damage equal to 30% of nearby enemies health, hacking them, and destroying any nearby barriers. Virus: Fire a projectile at an enemy that deals 10 damage on impact (20 damage if hacked.) Virus deals 100 damage over 4 seconds (2 seconds if hacked.) Not a head on fighter When playing Sombra, you should pretty rarely be pushing with the rest of your team. Sombra's abilities aren't effective when trying to fight head on, so you want to always be sneaking into their back line. You will want to use the Hack ability while still in stealth, as your enemy likely won't notice you quickly enough to stop you. It's important to note that while enemies' abilities are only disabled for a few short seconds, the hack lasts longer than that, making them visible to you through walls and weak to Virus. While hacking a tank so they can't use their abilities briefly can be useful in certain situations, the priority should be support heroes, followed by damage heroes. If you aren't sure who to prioritize, keep an eye on the kill feed and the scoreboard. You can use this information to target whomever is performing the best in the match or even bully the enemy team's weak link. The best way to maximize the Translocator Sombra no longer gets to set up her Translocator on a health pack to continuously return to. Now, if you want to exit a fight, you need to throw your Translocator, which automatically teleports you to it after 0.25 seconds. The important thing to remember with this change is that you won't go very far, since the Translocator can only travel so far before you teleport to it. The other thing is that when you want to exit a fight, you need to wait for the throwing animation to complete, so it's no longer instant. The teleport does reduce your stealth cooldown, so you will re-enter stealth shortly after teleporting to the Translocator. Infecting enemies Sombra's new ability is Virus, which you will need to land on an enemy if you want to take them out. Instead of the 40% damage boost on hacked enemies, you now need to land this projectile, which deals a small amount of damage on impact, followed by 100 damage over four seconds, or two seconds if the enemy is hacked. This means the strategy to kill enemies is to hack them, hit them with the virus, and use your pistol to finish the job. Something to keep in mind is that when enemies get hacked, they have a tendency to move erratically when it happens, making it difficult to land the virus. In some cases, it might make more sense to wait a moment or two to throw the virus. The EMP blastSombra's EMP blast can give your team some much needed momentum. The EMP blast is best used when the enemy team is all together, either pushing the objective or trying to stop your team. Just like the normal Hack, their abilities will be shut down for a few seconds, giving your team a chance to push hard. Since Sombra can get right into the middle of the action using Stealth before pulling the EMP, it's easy to wait for a good opportunity. Another great time to use the EMP is if the enemy team is using an ongoing ultimate ability, like Soldier 76's or Moria's. The EMP will shut down some enemies' ultimate abilities, making them a complete waste for the enemy team. Other Sombra tipsSombra can see enemies through walls when they are low on health. If you see an enemy retreating to heal, go pay them a visit. Sombra's normal hack ability can also stop some enemy ultimate abilities, but since it takes a moment for the ability to work, it can be harder to pull off than the EMP. You will also need to learn which ultimates it cancels and which ones it doesn't. Throwing your Translocator straight up in the air can be very effective, as your Stealth passive will kick back in before you hit the ground. The hack on health packs doesn't last forever, so make sure you are regularly topping it off. If you get too close to an enemy in Stealth, you will be exposed and become briefly visible, but it doesn't break your Stealth unless they do damage to you. Not every Hack needs to result in a kill, sometimes getting the enemy team to turn around to deal with you can make an opportunity for your team. Sombra is better suited for quickly eliminating an enemy, so don't sweat if you aren't dealing as much damage as your other damage hero, the eliminations are what matters.

Weekend 2 patch notesActivision is making a series of changes to the Modern Warfare III beta following the first weekend of testing. In addition to changes, the level cap is raising to 30 to give players the ability to unlock even more content. You can see the patch notes below, as shared by Activision. GAMEPLAYUIX Enemy Operators will now display a red nameplate above their head. Our team is preparing an update to decrease the slide to sprint delay. We’ll provide details on release timing as they become available. WEAPONSReduced Tac-Stance spread while sliding for several weapon classes. Assault Rifles: Decreased 17-26%. Submachine Guns: Decreased 14-17%. Light Machine Guns: Decreased 30-45%. Marksman Rifles: Decreased 29-31%. Pistols: Decreased 10-20%. Striker (Submachine Gun) Decreased near-medium damage from 39 to 36. Decreased near-medium damage range from 24m to 19m (-21%). Decreased medium damage range from 30m to 25m (-17%). Decreased far-medium damage from 28 to 27. Decreased minimum damage from 23 to 21. Increased headshot damage multiplier from 1.2x to 1.3x. Increased lower-arm damage multiplier from 1x to 1.1x. We expect the Striker to remain a competitive option thanks to its fire rate and excellent accuracy. However, these changes reduce its damage output at long distances, preventing it from outperforming Assault Rifles. Adjustments to damage multipliers intend to increase the consistency of this weapon. KILLSTREAKSGuardian-SCDecreased health from 550 to 400 (-27%). Decreased lifetime from 120s to 60s (-50%).

Created and produced by legendary manga artist Kentaro Miura--who passed away in 2021--Berserk is a visually stunning tale of swords, sorcery, and defying fate. In the wake of Prime Day Round 2, the gorgeous deluxe hardcover volumes of Berserk are still available for steeply discounted prices. It's not a bad time to catch up either, as the 14th and final deluxe volume of Berserk arrives next month. Along with containing the conclusion to the saga, Volume 14 features the Berserk Official Guidebook, which will help inform and contextualize your reading experience.

You can also save a bit on your preorder of Volume 14 ahead of its November 21 release. Each elegantly designed hardcover book is made of durable leatherette and contains three individual volumes reprinted in oversized format. These books clock in at roughly 700 pages each, so it's safe to say they will take up considerable shelf space (and look good while doing it). With a page size of 7\" x 10\", Miura's beautifully detailed art shines and allows you to appreciate the legend's masterpiece more easily. Like other manga books that have been translated to English, these versions retain the traditional right to left reading experience. If you're willing to take the dive, you'll find a haunting and tragic story in Berserk, as these manga graphic novels tell the tale of Guts, the Black Swordsman. A former mercenary damned to meet a terrible end thanks to the machinations of a man he once considered his greatest ally, Berserk is a tale for mature audiences, as it holds nothing back and regularly delivers brutal content on every page.

The first box set includes four volumes, which roughly corresponds to the first 13 episodes of the anime, while the second box set rounds out the second half of the debut season with its included volumes. The box sets move in sequential order and cover the entire Attack on Titan story arc. We also have several of the adaptations linked in case you'd like to see the brutal action unfold via animation--and the Attack on Titan anime doesn't disappoint in this department. If you're new to the franchise, Attack on Titan is set in a land where humanity has to deal with the small problem of powerful 10-20 meter giants that regularly attack and eat the populace alive. To make matters worse, these giants heal from injury almost instantly, and the only way to permanently kill these Titans is by slicing out the nape of the back of the neck. Thanks to some steampunk technology that turns soldiers into highly maneuverable Titan-slayers and massive walls that keep most of the populace safe, things are looking good for the survivors. That is, until one fateful day when the walls are breached by two unique Titans, allowing a flood of smaller giants to massacre the populace. Enter Eren Yeager, a survivor dedicated to killing all the Titans for good. He quickly becomes involved in a tale that exposes the true and horrifying origins of these giants. And that's just the appetizer before things really get weird and brutal.

Like previous years, this will be a celebration of all things Halloween, but with a Destiny 2 twist that revolves around exploring Haunted Sectors, battling the themed monsters within, and earning some gear for all your efforts. There will be some changes this year as part of an effort to make Festival of the Lost more rewarding, starting with the overall challenge of the event being increased. Bungie explained that Legend Haunted Sectors. Like Legend Lost Sectors, these zones will be filled with more challenging monsters and you'll need to be properly equipped to take on the ghoulish enemies inside of them. Finally, Kamen Rider armor in Destiny 2. The second big change is that players can earn Eerie Engrams from Haunted Sectors during the event, which can either be opened up for instant rewards or \"hocus-focused\" into a specific Exotic armor piece. Eva will offer players opportunities to acquire Exotic armor with four focusing categories in addition to the Legendary Weapons Eerie Engram focusing, but you will need to own the relevant expansion that the specific Exotic armor is tied to. You will not need to have acquired the Exotic armor previously for it to be eligible to drop from Hocus Focusing, which gives players a great opportunity to acquire Exotic gear that they're still missing. Usually, you'd need to grind your way--and without a fireteam--through Legend Lost Sectors to add a random Exotic that you don't already have, but this process will essentially take the randomness out of completing your collection. Focusing costs are 2,500 candy and an Eerie Engram per Exotic and 1,000 candy and an Eerie Engram for a specific Festival of the Lost weapon. If you'd prefer to roll the dice on a random weapon--this year offers familiar favorites like the Acosmic grenade launcher, Horror Story auto rifle, Jurassic Green pulse rifle, and Mechabre sniper rifle--you can spend 500 candy and an Eerie Engram for a quick pull. Players will only receive Exotic armor for the class that they are currently playing while interacting with Hocus Focusing, and you'll be able to add the following Exotics to your armory:Exotic Arms Eerie EngramNot even an intergalactic death-worshipping civilization can stop you from harvesting ingredients for pumpkin spice lattes.

Trick 'N Treat matches will take place on a series of \"After Dark\" maps, which see Apex's familiar locales renovated into dark, spooky maps for players to explore. The premise is simple--you must knock enemies, open Supply Bins, and break down doors to collect candy, which can then be consumed in exchange for an even more delectable treat: EVO Shield damage points, a boost to your Ultimate Ability charge, and a 25-hitpoint boost to your EVO Shield, assuming it is damaged. New Survival Item: Copycat KitBut with every treat comes a trick. In this case, it's the Copycat Kit, a new limited-time Survival Item that gives you access to an extra legend ability, which you may make use of for the rest of the match (though standard cooldown times still apply to any \"borrowed\" ability). Details on what kinds of abilities players can choose from have not been released, so it's unclear whether players will be able to choose from all ability types (including passive abilities), or if they'll be limited to choosing solely from the list of ultimate and/or tactical abilities. Regardless, it goes without saying that the Copycat Kit is a huge game-changer, and will likely make for absolute chaos on the battlefield once players get their hands on it. Revenant Prestige SkinSince Season 18 has revolved almost entirely around Revenant, the strange circumstances surrounding his recent transformation, and the wild events that unfolded thereafter, it's not surprising that the season's last Collection Event revolves around the spectral Spectre, too. To unlock Revenant's Apex Nightmare Prestige skin, players must collect all 24 cosmetics in the Doppelgangers Collection Event. This can be done by crafting the items with Crafting Metals, purchasing them directly with Apex Coins, or by purchasing 24 Doppelganger Event Packs--special Apex Packs that cost $7 USD each and are guaranteed to contain one item from the Doppelganger cosmetic collection. The Event Packs method is the cheapest way to attain the skin, unless you happen to have several hundreds of thousands of Crafting Metals on hand. In addition to the evolving, Mythic-tier Apex Nightmare skin, Revenant's Prestige Set also features a new finisher that sees the undead assassin's unfortunate victims being lifted off the ground and thoroughly eviscerated by strange appendages that appear to be some sort of ectoplasmic tentacles. The finisher then sees Revenant proceed to effectively consume the downed legend, dragging his prey's limp body right into his chassis before it snaps shut. No wonder Mirage is so concerned the sentient murder machine might attempt to eat him. Revenant's new finisher sees him impale his foes on strange spectral appendages before consuming them entirely. Every Prestige Set features a total of three items, but the third item included in the Revenant's Prestige Set has not yet been revealed. It could be an exclusive skydive trail, as skydive trails have been removed from Ranked Mode rewards, and Valkyrie's Prestige Set--released back in July--was the first of its kind to feature a skydive trail. But players who aren't looking to spend real cash can still join in the frightful festivities; the Doppelgangers Collection Event also features a free reward track featuring a number of cosmetic skins, Crafting Metals, and a music pack to really get the costume party started. The Doppelganger Collection Event will begin on Tuesday, October 17 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET, and players will want to make sure they've gotten all their trick-or-treating done before the event ends on Tuesday, October 31 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.

In addition to the evolving, Mythic-tier Apex Nightmare skin, Revenant's Prestige Set also features a new finisher that sees the undead assassin's unfortunate victims being lifted off the ground and thoroughly eviscerated by strange appendages that appear to be some sort of ectoplasmic tentacles. The finisher then sees Revenant proceed to effectively consume the downed legend, dragging his prey's limp body right into his chassis before it snaps shut.

Thankfully, the October 12 patch notes detail a major change to visibility, as enemy operators will now display a red nameplate above their head. A top gun to use in week one was the Striker submachine gun, and while it will likely still be worth leveling up and using, it has seen a significant nerf for week two. The gun now has decreased near-medium damage, as well as a reduction to medium, near-medium, and medium-far damage ranges. While it might have less range now, the Striker did receive a buff to improve the headshot damage and lower-arm multipliers. The Guardian-SC killstreak was pretty powerful in the first week, but it's nerfed for week two with a decrease to health and overall lifetime. For Ground War, vehicles driven by players no longer have limited fuel. The full patch notes can be found below, as shared by Activision.

The gun now has decreased near-medium damage, as well as a reduction to medium, near-medium, and medium-far damage ranges.

We've highlighted several deals below, starting with the sporty Apple Watch SE. This is no mere piece of time-keeping equipment--although it does do that--but an entry-level step into the world of wearable technology. The Apple Watch SE has several powerful features to help keep you connected, active, healthy, and safe, and right now, it has been discounted to $149. Both the GPS-only and GPS with Cellular models are available for this price. Since those models originally launched for $300-$350, this is quite the deal.

It even makes for a solid emergency device option, as this Apple Watch can detect if you’ve taken a hard fall, then automatically call emergency services for you. Not looking for a watch? Then maybe you'd like a slab of technology like an iPad. Walmart is currently offering a 2022 model Gen 10 iPad for $399, which normally costs $449. This Wi-Fi model has 64GB of internal storage capacity, a crisp 10.9-inch screen, and a powerful A14 chipset. This is a rock-solid general-use iPad, and can easily be used for multimedia purposes, a few games off of Apple Arcade, and even some light work when you're on the go. Lastly, Walmart is also offering some big savings on Apple AirPods. The Gen 2 Apple AirPods are discounted by $40 to $89, and these make for a comfortable option thanks to their open design. Like other AirPods, they also come with a charging case that can be used to refuel them between sessions. While they are more expensive, the AirPods Max is a very nice high-end headset.

The main series of creature-collecting RPGs and popular TCG are simple enough for children just starting to learn about role-playing-game mechanics, but with enough complexity and depth to support a flourishing competitive scene for adults. Pokemon's spin-offs, on the other hand, are usually more narrowly targeted, and that's the case for Detective Pikachu Returns. The narrative-heavy adventure game certainly has its charms, but it's so gentle and simplistic that only younger pocket monster fans need apply. Like the first Detective Pikachu, you play primarily as Tim Goodman, the college-aged son of renowned detective Harry Goodman, who has gone missing since before the first game. You're accompanied by Harry's partner, a Pikachu in a deerstalker cap who considers himself a great detective. Tim is the only human who can communicate with Pikachu, and while neither of them are officially part of any police force, they find themselves embroiled in investigations surrounding strange happenings in Ryme City. And naturally, Tim is still searching for answers about what happened to his father. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The crimes here are relatively low-stakes and child-friendly--a jewel heist, wrongful arrests of innocent Pokemon, and so on. For a series that has built its name on battling, there's shockingly little violence between Pokemon themselves. If two Pokemon are coming to blows, or even threatening to do so, it's treated like an emergency. That's because in Ryme City, Pokemon are treated like fellow citizens, and the city prides itself on peaceful coexistence between humans and the creatures. But while Ryme City is meant to be a bustling metropolis, I didn't get that impression from actually exploring the environments. Across the game's five cases, you explore an area of the city equivalent to, maybe, three or four city blocks, along with a few other locations outside the city. And even in the metropolitan areas, the setting is sparsely populated without much to see or do. There are a handful of people to talk to, or Pokemon to speak with using Pikachu as a translator, and most of them are mission critical. The others serve as simple side quests, requesting for example that you find a Pokemon strong enough to open a jar. These diorama-like sets are also remarkably narrow, straight paths, so most of your time is spent running back and forth across an almost 2D stretch of the street. Similarly simplistic are the puzzle solutions themselves. The game will prompt you when you've seen everything you need to see, so there's no chance you've missed vital evidence before forming a conclusion. When it comes time to deduce a solution, you're taken to a flowchart screen where your conclusions are presented in multiple choice. Most of the time, these reminded me of the quizzes I'd get in grade school, where at least one of the multiple choice answers was so comically wrong that the teacher obviously inserted it as a freebie for kids first learning how to use the process of elimination. If you somehow do get the answer wrong, there's no penalty at all; it simply Xs out the wrong answer and prompts you to try again. Then, once you've successfully deduced the answer, the dialogue will tell you almost exactly what you need to do next. The visual style is equally no-frills, with Pokemon rendered in a very basic presentation that actually grew on me as time went on. Pokemon are often at their best when their designs are simple and elegant, and since Detective Pikachu Returns doesn't have to render hundreds upon hundreds of the creatures, it was able to choose the ones that look the best using this visual language. This was most evident with Pikachu, who looks great in a wide variety of dialogue portraits that help give him personality. He's also very expressive and animated in occasional cutscenes, which is also where you get to hear the most of his unexpectedly gruff voice. Those also pepper in little jokes and visual gags, which was enough to elicit at least one belly laugh and a few other warm chuckles from me. While the bulk of the game is seen through the eyes of Tim Goodman, you do sometimes take control of Pikachu himself, as well as other Pokemon he's befriended to help in his investigations. Early on, you meet a Growlithe who can follow scents, for example, and later you find a Luxray who can see through walls. These moments are brief and very prescriptive, but it works well enough to break up the pace of the traditional adventure-game puzzles. When Detective Pikachu Returns does introduce a mechanic that seems like it could introduce some complexity--for example, at one point you're told you can only do something twice per day--it holds your hand so much that the new wrinkle doesn't really matter. And this being a mystery game for kids, I often found myself ahead of the writing. That's understandable, of course, since you want children to learn how the mystery genre works, but it also meant I spent a lot of time waiting for the characters to catch up with conclusions I had already made, and that made wading through the dialogue a bit dull. Plus, while the story ultimately concludes differently, some of the central mysteries in Detective Pikachu Returns share a lot in common with the Detective Pikachu live-action movie that came out four years ago, which put a damper on some of the ostensible surprises. Detective Pikachu Returns is charming and well-made enough for what it is, but that is a mystery game made for younger readers. Its setting, story, and mechanics are all geared toward gently introducing the uninitiated to mystery tropes with a soft-touch approach, and that makes it hard to recommend for any age group above tweens. There's some satisfaction to be had in seeing the story unfold, but mostly this is a game made to be played by or with kids, not to make you feel like a kid again.","length":8009,"tokens":1757,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Detective Pikachu Returns Review - Soft-Boiled","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/detective-pikachu-returns-review-soft-boiled/1900-6418128/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 3:26PM PDT","content":"Pokemon has flourished as a series in part because it crosses generations.

There's some satisfaction to be had in seeing the story unfold, but mostly this is a game made to be played by or with kids, not to make you feel like a kid again.","content_length":496,"content_tokens":107,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"EA Sports FC 24 Review - New Name, Same Game","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-fc-24-review-new-name-same-game/1900-6418129/","date":"October 4, 2023 at 3:16PM PDT","content":"Aside from the new name and logo being emblazoned on almost every menu screen in sight, you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish EA Sports FC 24 from the latest FIFA game. In short, EA's latest football sim introduces a number of subtle improvements to its on-pitch action while sprinkling in some incremental additions to long-standing game modes like Ultimate Team and Career. It still offers an exciting, albeit familiar, game of back-and-forth football, but the demanding yearly release schedule isn't doing the series any favors. Even with the fancy new rebrand, EA FC is an expected follow-up to FIFA 23, offering a slight evolution rather than anything revelatory. As is often the case from one game to the next, the pace of play in EA FC 24 feels a tad slower compared to last year. If history repeats itself, this is likely to change in the coming weeks--particularly once superpowered cards are more prevalent in Ultimate Team--but creating openings via slick passing moves is currently the best way to break down a stubborn defense. It helps that player movement is ultra-responsive, to the point where it's possible to wiggle out of danger without needing to utilize the game's agile dribbling mechanic. This is easier to do with a diminutive and agile player as opposed to someone like cover star Erling Haaland, but he excels in other areas, often bulldozing right through defenses. Either way, the movement of players--and their noticeable differences--looks much smoother than in the past; the connective animations between disparate movements flow together seamlessly. EA adds a deluge of new animations every year, but those in EA FC 24 lend the game a more natural look and feel that's immediately palpable in the way you move across the pitch. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Goalkeepers occasionally try to save shots by diving sideways into the goal, which usually results in them either punching the ball into their own net or letting it sail over their heads. Passes will sometimes veer wildly off target, and defending can be frustrating when successful tackles regularly bounce back to attackers, especially when it puts them in a much more advantageous position than they were in before. It doesn't help that off-the-ball AI still has trouble tracking runs, and referees are wildly inconsistent in regards to what is and isn't a foul. I've already encountered a few baffling red-card decisions--although one could argue this is sadly authentic. The removal of driven lobbed-through passes also takes some getting used to, but this seems to have been done in service of EA FC 24's new PlayStyles mechanic. PlayStyles make the differences between players even more pronounced by shining a spotlight on their strengths. Most players are equipped with a few distinct PlayStyles, pulling from a total of 32 that are spread across six categories: scoring, passing, ball control, defending, physical, and goalkeeper. It's fairly easy to notice when a player has a PlayStyle like Finesse Shot or Incisive Pass equipped because it feels much more satisfying to perform those actions. These aren't abilities you have to activate like a Mario Strikers power-up, either; they organically happen as you play. It's an intuitive system that fits into the natural flow of a match, tapping into each player's individuality by adding a fresh layer to the usual moment-to-moment gameplay. Most world-class players are also afforded a single PlayStyle+, which elevates a regular PlayStyle by bumping up its attributes to ensure that these players stand out. Mohamed Salah, for instance, has the aforementioned Finesse Shot set as his PlayStyle+, allowing him to perform finesse shots much faster and with more curvature and accuracy than other players. It's a signature ability that's reflective of the real player and emphasizes one of his main strengths. In the same way, a player like Joshua Kimmich can deliver a lobbed pass with more pace and accuracy than someone without the requisite PlayStyle+. Previously, almost any player could hit long passes on a dime. Now, it's the domain of the very best, giving you more options to consider when it comes to building a team. This shakes up Ultimate Team--EA's card-collecting cash cow--because you might not always choose a player based solely on their ratings. This is also doubly true now that players from the women's game have been integrated into Ultimate Team, with six women's leagues--including the Barclays Women's Super League and National Women's Soccer League--creating even more squad-building opportunities. With everyone from Sam Kerr to Alexia Putellas, the influx of female players are well-balanced for mixed-gender matches. The attributes between men and women are equal, so Lena Oberdorf can utilize her strength the same way Virgil van Dijk can. Still, most of the female players are better suited to specific positions and roles due to their height, much the same as their male counterparts. Shorter goalkeepers, for instance, tend to leak goals despite their attributes, so it's rare to find a team willing to start a female 'keeper. It's the same problem that afflicts five-foot six-inch Jorge Campos and his Hero card. At the other end of the pitch, however, the close control and low center of gravity players like Marta possess are sure to shake up the Ultimate Team meta, especially once more special cards are released. Ultimate Team improves in a few other areas, too. Position modifiers are a thing of the past, so players can now simply slot into any of their secondary positions without needing to spend a resource to do so. This gives you more room to experiment with both formations and where to position specific players, especially when their PlayStyle+ might be better suited elsewhere depending on your own playstyle. Squad Battles matches are also mercifully shorter this time around, dropping from six-minute halves to only four-minute periods either side of halftime. This prevents these clashes against the CPU from feeling like too much of a slog while still giving you enough time to tick off a few objectives. Evolutions, on the other hand, is an exciting new feature that gives you the chance to improve and customize players from your club for the first time. If a player meets certain criteria, you can choose to evolve them by completing a number of challenges--such as winning four games with that player in your starting 11--to unlock a permanent stat upgrade. Different types of Evolutions will cycle through each season, but at launch, one of the options lets you take a bronze player with a maximum rating of 64 and transform them into an 84-rated gold player. This is exciting for supporters of lower-league teams because it gives you the chance to actually use one of your favorite players in Ultimate Team. It also means you don't have to rely solely on pack luck. You now have the potential to improve your starting striker to keep up with the power curve without needing to spend coins on a new one or pray you pull one in packs. The one downside to Evolutions is that it provides another avenue for predatory microtransactions. While most of the current Evolutions are free, there's one upgrade path that lets you transform a winger from a 79 rating to an 85 rating. It costs either 50,000 in-game coins--not an insignificant amount--or 1,000 FC Points. The latter can only be purchased with real money, either in 100-point increments at $1 each, or 1,050 points for $10. This is just another layer to Ultimate Team's inherent imbalance, where those willing to spend money have a much better chance of building a strong team than those who don't. EA FC 24 has already courted controversy by introducing an Elite Season Opener Pack that costs 285,000 coins or 3,000 FC Points. It's ostensibly a pay-to-win bundle, but one that also has a chance of giving you little more than a pile of duplicates. I'm sure EA received a fat check to make sure every Ultimate Team match is \"delivered by Amazon Prime,\" so it's more than a little dystopian that it's still asking for extra money from its already-paying customers. Gallery Fortunately, microtransactions haven't yet made their way into either Player or Manager Career. The former adds Player Agents to help flesh out the mode by giving you a checklist of objectives to complete throughout the season in order to earn a new contract at your current team or transfer to a new club. This sounds like a solid idea in theory, but some of the objectives are completely nonsensical. You could score 40 goals but still be released from your contract because five of them weren't overhead kicks. Other objectives task you with achieving feats no player ever has before, like accomplishing 37 assists across a single season. Manager Career fares better by introducing seven tactical identities for you to choose from. You might opt for a defensive approach with Park the Bus or use Gegenpressing to relentlessly press your opponents high up the pitch. You then need to hire coaches that match your identity, with better coaches boosting the attributes of your players. Again, this is a solid idea, but I didn't notice it having a tactile effect on how my players felt to control. Once again, the series' single-player modes feel like an afterthought compared to Ultimate Team. EA Sports FC 24 is a better game than FIFA 23, but only marginally so. PlayStyles, Evolutions, and the addition of women in Ultimate Team are all positive steps forward, but it takes just as many steps back. The same gameplay issues continue to crop up, Career mode is underbaked, and Ultimate Team is still marred by the inescapable presence of microtransactions--and they've only gotten worse. The on-pitch action is excellent, with some frustrating caveats, and it's capable of moments of pure footballing joy. For those expecting a reinvention to go along with the new name, this is not that. EA FC 24 is the same ugly, beautiful game.","length":11892,"tokens":2582,"chunks":[{"post_title":"EA Sports FC 24 Review - New Name, Same Game","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-fc-24-review-new-name-same-game/1900-6418129/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 3:16PM PDT","content":"Aside from the new name and logo being emblazoned on almost every menu screen in sight, you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish EA Sports FC 24 from the latest FIFA game.

Although it serves as somewhat of a prequel for Valhalla, Assassin's Creed Mirage doesn't push the series' story in new directions, opting instead for a narrative that is heavily dependent on you already knowing Basim's story in Valhalla. Mirage does get back to the basics that first defined the series by refocusing on social stealth and making it fun to learn about a city's history, but a weak cast of characters keeps it from reaching the same heights as some of its earliest predecessors. Ubisoft Bordeaux's vision of ninth-century Baghdad stands out as the most compelling part of Mirage. While I can't speak to its authenticity, Baghdad's colorful, multi-layered architecture creates a playground of possibilities, offering numerous avenues for navigating the city, sneaking past guards, and reaching your objective. Freerunning is intuitive, though occasionally clumsy in its design, with Basim sometimes getting snagged on corners or leaping off rooftops in a way I didn't intend. These mishaps are thankfully not very common, allowing you to focus on strategizing how you want to get from one building to the next. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

In the earliest days of the franchise, Assassin's Creed helped me pass my History classes by making European history fun to learn about, and Mirage does the same here for Baghdad, highlighting the golden age of a city and culture not often touched on in world history and certainly not in modern media. It's all presented with the usual odd and outdated assortment of quirks of past Assassin's Creed games, with characters slipping in and out of their native tongue mid-sentence and using expressions that haven't been coined yet, but uncovering the many intricacies of Baghdad has been fascinating for someone like me who doesn't have a firm grasp of Islamic culture and history. Baghdad is fun to explore both from a gameplay perspective--with an assortment of pulleys, platforms, balconies, and rooftops transforming the whole city into a parkour playground--and a historical one, bringing life and culture to Mirage in a way none of the actual main characters manage to do. You'll be exploring that city as Basim Ibn Ishaq, a talented street thief who eventually joins the Hidden Ones, the precursors to the Assassin Brotherhood. Basim is assigned to eliminate the various members of the Order of Ancients, the precursors to the Templar Order, who control Baghdad from the shadows. Leaning into his origins as a thief, Basim excels at subterfuge and stealth. You can openly fight enemies in Mirage, and Basim is a fierce duelist who can parry and execute individual enemies with satisfying ease. However, once you're confronted by three or more guards, Basim's skillset is far better suited to running away and hiding. This encourages you to embrace the social-stealth elements in the game--hiding in plain sight within crowds, scouting areas from the rooftops, and utilizing an assortment of gadgets to mask your presence or distract enemies. Mirage includes several fun nods to previous Assassin's Creed games, including the first one. The gadgets at his disposal range from throwing knives and sleep darts to noisemakers and traps, and they can be customized with materials discovered in hidden chests or earned by completing optional contracts, allowing you to further define your ideal approach to stealth. The throwing knives, for example, can be strengthened to cut through thick armor, enabling you to stealthily take down even the strongest of enemies, or you can instead coat them with a corrosive material meaning they'll dissolve the bodies of weaker enemies and leave behind no trace for others to find. You unlock new tools, new options for your tools, and new abilities for Basim at a fairly regular rate, and Mirage allows you to easily tweak your build. Like previous Assassin's Creed games, the enemy AI in Mirage is dumb as rocks and they'll fall for the same tricks over and over. This is particularly noticeable in Mirage, as this game places more of an emphasis on stealth and makes Basim much less of a powerhouse, but the enemies don't present any sort of opposition in most cases. Challenge is instead dictated by enemy placement, Basim's resources, and the design of buildings. Utilizing Basim's eagle companion and all-seeing supernatural Eagle Vision ability, you can scout an area to get the lay of the land, map enemy positions, and then plan how you're going to use your assortment of stocked tools and freerunning abilities to navigate the space without drawing attention. Breaking stealth is never punished with an immediate game over--keeping each mission from becoming overly frustrating--but failing certain conditions, like preventing multiple guards from seeing you or not stopping a lookout from sounding an alarm, can lead to a game over. With an area on high alert, Basim can be swarmed by enemies, which in turn can up the challenge considerably, and since you're not a Greek demi-god or Viking berserker like in the last two Assassin's Creed games, it's better not to be outnumbered. Because of this, there's still a gratifying tension to maintaining your stealth. There are more than immediate consequences to being discovered as well. As citizens watch Basim in action, they'll report him to the city's guards for his transgressions. A more lethal playstyle allows Basim to handle threats quickly and effectively but at the cost of citizens reacting with much more vitriol toward him if they see him do the deed. While putting guards to sleep, blinding them with smoke, or taking the time to safely circumnavigate them will keep you off the city's radar, it can come at the cost of losing sight of your target or missing your chance to take advantage of a distraction, so it's a balancing act of risk versus reward. As Basim's notoriety climbs, the city becomes more dangerous to him. Citizens will recognize him when he tries to blend into groups and call for the guards, archers will patrol the rooftops, and specialized bounty hunters will pursue him across the city. It pays to remain hidden and unnoticed when planning an assassination mission, lest you make getting around the city much more laborious and dangerous once the mission is complete. And if the heat gets to be too much for you, taking a break to rip down wanted posters and bribe city heralds can lower your notoriety. Against a few guards, Basim can hold his own but he crumbles against a group. I found notoriety to be too lenient of a system, however. The entire basis of its threat is that enemies more easily recognize Basim and pursue him with more aggression but, again, the enemy AI isn't very smart. Rarely do they react in a timely enough manner for a citizen's warnings to lead to a chase, and even when they do, Basim is far more nimble on the rooftops than his pursuers. The random nature of chases lacks the curated placement of guards in stealth encounters as well, completely negating any sort of challenge and making the increased notoriety more of a mild annoyance than anything else. Instead of feeling like the city is becoming more aware of you and testing you to utilize every trick you have in a desperate gamble to reduce your notoriety, it feels like the game is trying to force a mild frustration onto you that you have to take care of before you can go back to enjoying it. Thankfully, these forced breaks from tackling your next assignment are the only ones you have to make--no one will be pulling you out of the simulation this time around. Like past games in the franchise, the entire experience of Mirage is a virtual-reality simulation being watched by someone in the present day. However, there is hardly any modern-day storyline in Mirage; something we haven't seen since 2012's Assassin's Creed: Liberation. Much like Liberation, there's a short intro at the start of Mirage that lets you know you're actually playing as someone in the present day who is using an advanced virtual-reality program to relive Basim's life. And like Liberation, it's never brought up again. You aren't woken up at key moments partway through the story to see what's happening in the present day. This is solely Basim's story. Mirage is one of the most concise Assassin's Creed storylines we've had in a decade as a result. Every part of the storyline is written in service of Basim's journey without needing to twist it in some way to answer a question posed by a secondary present-day protagonist. Without another face distracting the narrative, we're allowed to focus on Basim and see how his desperate struggle to make the world a better place for the likes of the downtrodden becomes twisted and jaded over time. There's a genuine earnestness to him that slowly erodes as he's faced with the complexities of balancing a desire to serve the greater good and an ever-present need to serve himself. The issue that Mirage runs into is that this characterization doesn't stand on its own. Basim doesn't have much of a narrative arc throughout Mirage; instead, his journey leans on the knowledge that he is destined for a tragic fall that will twist him into becoming one of the main antagonists to Eivor in Valhalla. Basim's storyline is filled with hints and misdirects, toying with you as it pulls you along, leaving you guessing as to what's finally going to be the catalyst for his eventual downfall only to then conclude when he finally reaches some semblance of development. There's a whole lot of context missing if you haven't played Valhalla, and Basim's story is only interesting if you have that context. Without it, you're left wondering what the journey was all for.<img alt=\"We first met Basim in Assassin's Creed Valhalla as an older and wiser Hidden One.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4200880-acv_basim_promo. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4200880-acv_basim_promo. jpg 1400w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4200880-acv_basim_promo. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4200880-acv_basim_promo. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">We first met Basim in Assassin's Creed Valhalla as an older and wiser Hidden One. The game's story doesn't completely fall apart without knowing Basim's future, however. Basim's story is told within the confines of his hunt for the Order of Ancients, the stakes of which are laid plain in Mirage's opening act. The Order wants to control society. The Hidden Ones think that's bad and want to stop them to preserve people's personal freedoms. Basim is a Hidden One so his stance on the matter is pretty cut-and-dry. There's no personal investment helping you to buy into Basim's motivations for hunting the Order down but the game at least sets up that he may at least feel duty-bound to the task at hand. It's not enough to make things interesting but the loose framework works out and it at least brings you into Mirage's most enjoyable gameplay loop: the investigations. Basim's hunt for the Order is organized into individual cases, tasking you with uncovering clues that eventually reveal the location of the lower-ranking members of the Order of Ancients. As you kill these targets, their deaths slowly reveal the true identity of the handful of big bads that they serve, unlocking the mission to go hunt them down. The hunt for the Order of Ancients is at the center of Mirage's gameplay loop, injecting the freeform nature of how these hunts worked in Odyssey and Valhalla within the step-by-step framework of the original Assassin's Creed. Though the beginning and end of Mirage are entirely linear, the middle portion is completely open, allowing you to tackle three separate investigations in whatever order you want. The freedom to chase leads at your leisure encourages you to go after whatever interests you, with every lead reliably leading to the satisfaction of crossing another name off your list. Many of the smaller cases crisscross with one another as well, unifying the open-ended nature of Mirage into a more concise narrative. At the end of the day, you're trying to unearth the face behind the mask at the top of this branch of the Order, but the very nature of your investigations clues you into how the entire group has insidiously wormed their way into the inner echelons of Baghdad. You are a predator and the Order is your prey, but as you fill out your evidence board with clues, you quickly discern how those roles could be reversed. The Order is everywhere and their influence touches almost every aspect of Baghdad. It's not hard to believe that one of your allies may secretly be one of them, and I remained glued to every conversation Basim had with his friends if only to discern hints of a future betrayal that may or may not come.<img alt=\"Mirage's characters struggle to leave an impact.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4191392-talk. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4191392-talk. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4191392-talk. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4191392-talk. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Mirage's characters struggle to leave an impact. The benefit of such an intriguing twist is lessened by Mirage's weak cast, however. Beyond Basim's closest allies--his childhood friend and fellow street thief, Nehal, and his mentor and surrogate mother, Roshan--the rest of the characters are paper-thin and forgettable stand-ins who are really just there to deliver exposition. Most of the conversations Basim has with other characters left me wanting for more, or at least wishing for more time with Nehal or Roshan instead. Both women act as foils to one another and provide further insight into Basim. Whereas Nehal wants Basim to pursue his own personal agency and seek care for the nightmarish visions that have plagued him his entire life, Roshan admonishes Basim for seeking these answers and demands he instead pours his pain and trauma into being a better killer. It's an interesting dichotomy that's not given the space to be explored in any sort of entertaining way. Both women, despite touching on potentially interesting themes of identity and coming to terms with one's past, are practically nonexistent within the story, only popping up briefly to pose an idea before leaving just as quickly. Worse, their characterization almost seems to leapfrog from scene to scene, with both shifting in how they feel about Basim with an unrealistic swiftness that doesn't feel authentic to how human emotions work. Nehal, in particular, gave me whiplash for how quickly she forgave Basim for an earlier transgression, only to then reappear hours later somehow still angry with him. By the time the credits rolled, I was annoyed that Nehal and Roshan share so few back-to-back scenes to really hammer home how the two sides of Basim--one of which seeks the truth while the other blindly fulfills duty--are struggling for dominance of his consciousness. This internal strife is at the center of Basim's tragedy and could have brought those aspects of Basim's story from Valhalla into Mirage. Instead, the build-up of these opposing ideas falls flat at the climax, highlighting how so much of the dialogue in Mirage is tedious conversations with boring supporting characters.<img alt=\"Roshan is voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, known for also voicing characters in Mass Effect and Destiny.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png 1677w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Roshan is voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, known for also voicing characters in Mass Effect and Destiny. Regardless, your efforts in unraveling the mysteries of the Order culminate in rewarding assassination missions. These resemble the Black Box missions seen in Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate, with Basim tasked with infiltrating an area, uncovering the identity and location of his target, learning of possible ways to assassinate them, and then executing a plan. These five assignments are the best part of the game, leaning into a mission structure that prioritizes creative reactivity. Each of these assignments is located in a different area, creating its own variety of challenges. An assassination in an auction tasks you with securing a specific item to gain an audience with your target, but it's up to you to decide if you're going to just buy the item outright or steal it from one of the other prospective buyers. Meanwhile, an assassination within an underground dungeon requires you to figure out how to even get down there in the first place and whether it's better to kill the guards inside or risk hiding among the prisoners. Basim can unlock new pathways forward in these Black Box missions by bribing servants for information, stealing keys from guards, eavesdropping on conversations, or finding and donning disguises. You can also just murder everything that stands between you and the target if you so wish, though that's a difficult prospect given the number of guards devoted to these locations. During these Black Box missions, Mirage provides guidance on what you should do next--find a way downstairs, for instance, or draw your target out of hiding--but these are general guidelines with room for improvisation in how you go about completing them, and it's so fulfilling to see your well-laid plans come together and rewarded with crossing another name off your list. Assassin's Creed Mirage is a true prequel to Valhalla, only able to tell a compelling narrative arc for Basim with the knowledge of what he becomes later in life. At the very least, you don't need an encyclopedic understanding of Assassin's Creed to appreciate Basim's growth from a young street thief to a duty-bound assassin to a truth-seeking detective as he looks into the interconnected investigations that unlock the enjoyable Black Box assassination missions. And though uninteresting characters mar the experience, an emphasis on social stealth and a history-rich city curate a fun (and educational!) gameplay loop.","length":21034,"tokens":4695,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"Back in 2020 when I reviewed Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I talked about how much that game's story had a real sense of finality to it, bringing together and concluding dozens of narrative threads from across the franchise.

Challenge is instead dictated by enemy placement, Basim's resources, and the design of buildings. Utilizing Basim's eagle companion and all-seeing supernatural Eagle Vision ability, you can scout an area to get the lay of the land, map enemy positions, and then plan how you're going to use your assortment of stocked tools and freerunning abilities to navigate the space without drawing attention. Breaking stealth is never punished with an immediate game over--keeping each mission from becoming overly frustrating--but failing certain conditions, like preventing multiple guards from seeing you or not stopping a lookout from sounding an alarm, can lead to a game over.","content_length":877,"content_tokens":169,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"With an area on high alert, Basim can be swarmed by enemies, which in turn can up the challenge considerably, and since you're not a Greek demi-god or Viking berserker like in the last two Assassin's Creed games, it's better not to be outnumbered. Because of this, there's still a gratifying tension to maintaining your stealth. There are more than immediate consequences to being discovered as well. As citizens watch Basim in action, they'll report him to the city's guards for his transgressions.

As Basim's notoriety climbs, the city becomes more dangerous to him. Citizens will recognize him when he tries to blend into groups and call for the guards, archers will patrol the rooftops, and specialized bounty hunters will pursue him across the city. It pays to remain hidden and unnoticed when planning an assassination mission, lest you make getting around the city much more laborious and dangerous once the mission is complete. And if the heat gets to be too much for you, taking a break to rip down wanted posters and bribe city heralds can lower your notoriety.

The entire basis of its threat is that enemies more easily recognize Basim and pursue him with more aggression but, again, the enemy AI isn't very smart. Rarely do they react in a timely enough manner for a citizen's warnings to lead to a chase, and even when they do, Basim is far more nimble on the rooftops than his pursuers. The random nature of chases lacks the curated placement of guards in stealth encounters as well, completely negating any sort of challenge and making the increased notoriety more of a mild annoyance than anything else. Instead of feeling like the city is becoming more aware of you and testing you to utilize every trick you have in a desperate gamble to reduce your notoriety, it feels like the game is trying to force a mild frustration onto you that you have to take care of before you can go back to enjoying it.","content_length":903,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"Thankfully, these forced breaks from tackling your next assignment are the only ones you have to make--no one will be pulling you out of the simulation this time around. Like past games in the franchise, the entire experience of Mirage is a virtual-reality simulation being watched by someone in the present day. However, there is hardly any modern-day storyline in Mirage; something we haven't seen since 2012's Assassin's Creed: Liberation. Much like Liberation, there's a short intro at the start of Mirage that lets you know you're actually playing as someone in the present day who is using an advanced virtual-reality program to relive Basim's life. And like Liberation, it's never brought up again. You aren't woken up at key moments partway through the story to see what's happening in the present day. This is solely Basim's story.

Without another face distracting the narrative, we're allowed to focus on Basim and see how his desperate struggle to make the world a better place for the likes of the downtrodden becomes twisted and jaded over time. There's a genuine earnestness to him that slowly erodes as he's faced with the complexities of balancing a desire to serve the greater good and an ever-present need to serve himself. The issue that Mirage runs into is that this characterization doesn't stand on its own. Basim doesn't have much of a narrative arc throughout Mirage; instead, his journey leans on the knowledge that he is destined for a tragic fall that will twist him into becoming one of the main antagonists to Eivor in Valhalla.","content_length":892,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"Basim's storyline is filled with hints and misdirects, toying with you as it pulls you along, leaving you guessing as to what's finally going to be the catalyst for his eventual downfall only to then conclude when he finally reaches some semblance of development.

It's not enough to make things interesting but the loose framework works out and it at least brings you into Mirage's most enjoyable gameplay loop: the investigations. Basim's hunt for the Order is organized into individual cases, tasking you with uncovering clues that eventually reveal the location of the lower-ranking members of the Order of Ancients.

The freedom to chase leads at your leisure encourages you to go after whatever interests you, with every lead reliably leading to the satisfaction of crossing another name off your list. Many of the smaller cases crisscross with one another as well, unifying the open-ended nature of Mirage into a more concise narrative.

It's an interesting dichotomy that's not given the space to be explored in any sort of entertaining way. Both women, despite touching on potentially interesting themes of identity and coming to terms with one's past, are practically nonexistent within the story, only popping up briefly to pose an idea before leaving just as quickly.

This internal strife is at the center of Basim's tragedy and could have brought those aspects of Basim's story from Valhalla into Mirage. Instead, the build-up of these opposing ideas falls flat at the climax, highlighting how so much of the dialogue in Mirage is tedious conversations with boring supporting characters.<img alt=\"Roshan is voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, known for also voicing characters in Mass Effect and Destiny.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot.","content_length":897,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png 1677w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan. png 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4195038-assassins_creed_mirage_roshan.","content_length":417,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Assassin's Creed Mirage Review - Back To Basics","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/","post_date":"October 4, 2023 at 11:32AM PDT","content":"png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Roshan is voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, known for also voicing characters in Mass Effect and Destiny.

Basim can unlock new pathways forward in these Black Box missions by bribing servants for information, stealing keys from guards, eavesdropping on conversations, or finding and donning disguises.

Assassin's Creed Mirage is a true prequel to Valhalla, only able to tell a compelling narrative arc for Basim with the knowledge of what he becomes later in life. At the very least, you don't need an encyclopedic understanding of Assassin's Creed to appreciate Basim's growth from a young street thief to a duty-bound assassin to a truth-seeking detective as he looks into the interconnected investigations that unlock the enjoyable Black Box assassination missions.

Helpfully, Capcom had excellent source material to work from, which isn't the case for the original's add-on, Separate Ways. Don't get me wrong, Ada Wong's solo outing was a fun excuse to re-enter the dilapidated world of RE4, but the original add-on did little to differentiate its gameplay from the main campaign and didn't make itself essential to the overall experience from a narrative perspective either. The remake of Separate Ways, however, is the opposite, adding several new tools to its core gameplay, shaking up familiar environments with completely new set pieces, and fleshing out the story. Far from being a throwaway add-on, Resident Evil 4 remake's version of Separate Ways makes an already phenomenal game feel even more complete. The foundation of Separate Ways' premise remains the same as in the original: You step into the high heels of antiheroine Ada Wong and act as a spy to hunt down a biological weapon for longtime Resident Evil antagonist Albert Wesker. Her allegiances, however, are ambiguous, with Ada playing multiple sides in the story, sometimes working against Wesker and assisting Leon on his mission to save the president's daughter Ashley Graham or partnering up with suave biologist Luis Sera. She has a dual motive for nearly everything she does. But this time around, the stakes have been turned up a notch, as Ada is also infected with plagas--the same parasitic disease that's infected the villagers, Leon, and Ashley in the main story. This additional layer gives Ada a stronger motive for working alongside Luis, who is the answer to finding a cure. This, in turn, merits a whole lot more welcomed screen time for our charismatic and ever-charming Spanish biologist too. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Additionally, she has access to an augmented-reality implant that allows her to see footsteps or fingerprints, both of which are used to track characters like Luis or reveal button presses, acting as mini-puzzles to bypass locked doors. It's a bespoke gameplay system for Ada that adds an extra wrinkle to her campaign and emphasizes a detective-like quality that we haven't seen in any previous Resident Evil. The inclusion of these mechanics adds much-needed texture to Ada, painting her as the capable and resourceful spy we've always been told she is, but have never seen firsthand. Usually, she appears at the most convenient moments to help another character out or provide a weapon, but now we get to see how she uses her own skills to track characters down and complete missions from the shadows. As a result of the extra gadgetry, the tone of the game leans unabashedly into its spy aesthetic, using Sean Connery-era Bond twangy guitars to underpin Ada's mission--it makes everything feel cool and suave, which Ada Wong is. Contrary to Leon's one-liner-action-hero demeanor, Ada is reserved, serious, and calculated, which voice actress Lily Gao nails in her performance. There's a dryness in her tone and an imperious air to her delivery. It's a grounded representation of the character that stands out among the melodrama of its other cast, especially Albert Wesker, who seems to be carrying the weight of the franchise's theatrics in every airy line he delivers, and somehow it still works. Naturally, the emphasis on espionage also brings with it a lot more stealth. Familiar levels from before, like the castle walls, have been redesigned to encourage the player to sneak around and take down ganados methodically. However, at times, its encouragement to employ stealth felt more like a means to bolster its spy-like vibe than serve any purposeful challenge. Too often, enemies were positioned conveniently facing away from me or simply walking in circles, with an obvious blindspot I could enter to take them down. It felt like stealth-on-rails and was unrewarding as a result. But stealth is optional, so you don't have to play it cool and quiet, and you can jump in, knives swinging and guns blazing. The game feels better with that approach, too, as it's where Ada's new abilities shine. Ada's new ability to grapple toward enemies, which appears as a button prompt when staggering enemies, makes combat feel punchier, more dynamic, and more damn stylish than before. There's an added risk/reward when closing the gap between you and a crowd of ganados, followed by a waltz of gunfire, knife parries, and melee violence. Additionally, the zipline allows for quick traversal out of claustrophobic encounters via prompts scattered all around you. This also opens the door to pitting you against familiar enemies in unfamiliar environments. The hedge maze, for example, was a new combat arena where I could zipline over walls while trying to hunt down one enemy and dodging the grasp of others. The last major addition to Ada's zipline is the ability to yank shields from enemies, which is a skill that comes in the form of a charm that can be purchased from the Merchant. It's reminiscent of Batman's grapple gun in Rocksteady's Arkham games in its ability to rob enemies of their defenses. Separate Ways also tells a story not explored in the original at all and serves as its biggest achievement in defining itself as an essential extension to Leon's campaign. While the original was similar in showing how Ada assisted Leon, this remake creates deeper connections and new plotlines that make it vital to understand the full scope of what's at stake. Ada's infection is used as a throughline to establish Pesanta, the black-hooded foe from Leon's campaign who mysteriously disappeared, as a relentless antagonist who stalks Ada throughout her mission. Separate Ways takes significant liberties in fleshing out its story, often by reintroducing iconic scenes from the original's main campaign that were omitted in the remake. Some of these iconic scenes, like the infamous laser hall, actually fit better stylistically within the context of Ada's Mission Impossible-esque story. In some ways, this DLC serves as a nice love letter to longtime fans more than the actual remake does because of the inclusion of these scenes. At times, though, it can also feel heavy-handed, with some moments being reimagined less successfully than others. Gallery Where things like the aforementioned laser hall fit with Ada's gymnastic prowess and high-tech abilities, and the drilling spike wall works nicely with the pulpy spy tone, the U-3 fight felt wedged in. Separate Ways does a far better job of contextualizing U-3 as a throughline in ways I'd rather not spoil, but it doesn't quite find its footing in the execution, resulting in the campaign's most bland boss fight and the omission of the scariest part of its original. It is reduced to a languishing and uninspired arena fight. Still, it's a minor misstep in comparison to the many excellent boss fights Separate Ways manages to fit into its modest but action-packed four hours, some of which outshine even the main game's fights. Ada's showdown with Saddler, for example, is particularly memorable due in part to some cutscene badassery in its final moments. Separate Ways isn't just more Resident Evil 4. It's a meaningful expansion that delivers a new story through a distinct tone and with new mechanics. It is an essential extension of an already remarkable game. Although its nods to the past can feel a bit overt, it still packs a punch that'll have me playing it many times over again.","length":9630,"tokens":2137,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"Capcom's Resident Evil 4 remake takes one of the greatest games of all time and rebuilds it into a masterpiece that stands right alongside the original. Helpfully, Capcom had excellent source material to work from, which isn't the case for the original's add-on, Separate Ways. Don't get me wrong, Ada Wong's solo outing was a fun excuse to re-enter the dilapidated world of RE4, but the original add-on did little to differentiate its gameplay from the main campaign and didn't make itself essential to the overall experience from a narrative perspective either. The remake of Separate Ways, however, is the opposite, adding several new tools to its core gameplay, shaking up familiar environments with completely new set pieces, and fleshing out the story. Far from being a throwaway add-on, Resident Evil 4 remake's version of Separate Ways makes an already phenomenal game feel even more complete.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"The foundation of Separate Ways' premise remains the same as in the original: You step into the high heels of antiheroine Ada Wong and act as a spy to hunt down a biological weapon for longtime Resident Evil antagonist Albert Wesker. Her allegiances, however, are ambiguous, with Ada playing multiple sides in the story, sometimes working against Wesker and assisting Leon on his mission to save the president's daughter Ashley Graham or partnering up with suave biologist Luis Sera. She has a dual motive for nearly everything she does. But this time around, the stakes have been turned up a notch, as Ada is also infected with plagas--the same parasitic disease that's infected the villagers, Leon, and Ashley in the main story. This additional layer gives Ada a stronger motive for working alongside Luis, who is the answer to finding a cure. This, in turn, merits a whole lot more welcomed screen time for our charismatic and ever-charming Spanish biologist too.","content_length":966,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

It's a bespoke gameplay system for Ada that adds an extra wrinkle to her campaign and emphasizes a detective-like quality that we haven't seen in any previous Resident Evil. The inclusion of these mechanics adds much-needed texture to Ada, painting her as the capable and resourceful spy we've always been told she is, but have never seen firsthand. Usually, she appears at the most convenient moments to help another character out or provide a weapon, but now we get to see how she uses her own skills to track characters down and complete missions from the shadows.","content_length":804,"content_tokens":161,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"As a result of the extra gadgetry, the tone of the game leans unabashedly into its spy aesthetic, using Sean Connery-era Bond twangy guitars to underpin Ada's mission--it makes everything feel cool and suave, which Ada Wong is. Contrary to Leon's one-liner-action-hero demeanor, Ada is reserved, serious, and calculated, which voice actress Lily Gao nails in her performance. There's a dryness in her tone and an imperious air to her delivery. It's a grounded representation of the character that stands out among the melodrama of its other cast, especially Albert Wesker, who seems to be carrying the weight of the franchise's theatrics in every airy line he delivers, and somehow it still works. Naturally, the emphasis on espionage also brings with it a lot more stealth.","content_length":774,"content_tokens":172,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"Familiar levels from before, like the castle walls, have been redesigned to encourage the player to sneak around and take down ganados methodically. However, at times, its encouragement to employ stealth felt more like a means to bolster its spy-like vibe than serve any purposeful challenge. Too often, enemies were positioned conveniently facing away from me or simply walking in circles, with an obvious blindspot I could enter to take them down. It felt like stealth-on-rails and was unrewarding as a result. But stealth is optional, so you don't have to play it cool and quiet, and you can jump in, knives swinging and guns blazing. The game feels better with that approach, too, as it's where Ada's new abilities shine. Ada's new ability to grapple toward enemies, which appears as a button prompt when staggering enemies, makes combat feel punchier, more dynamic, and more damn stylish than before.","content_length":905,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"There's an added risk/reward when closing the gap between you and a crowd of ganados, followed by a waltz of gunfire, knife parries, and melee violence. Additionally, the zipline allows for quick traversal out of claustrophobic encounters via prompts scattered all around you. This also opens the door to pitting you against familiar enemies in unfamiliar environments. The hedge maze, for example, was a new combat arena where I could zipline over walls while trying to hunt down one enemy and dodging the grasp of others. The last major addition to Ada's zipline is the ability to yank shields from enemies, which is a skill that comes in the form of a charm that can be purchased from the Merchant. It's reminiscent of Batman's grapple gun in Rocksteady's Arkham games in its ability to rob enemies of their defenses.","content_length":820,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"Separate Ways also tells a story not explored in the original at all and serves as its biggest achievement in defining itself as an essential extension to Leon's campaign. While the original was similar in showing how Ada assisted Leon, this remake creates deeper connections and new plotlines that make it vital to understand the full scope of what's at stake. Ada's infection is used as a throughline to establish Pesanta, the black-hooded foe from Leon's campaign who mysteriously disappeared, as a relentless antagonist who stalks Ada throughout her mission. Separate Ways takes significant liberties in fleshing out its story, often by reintroducing iconic scenes from the original's main campaign that were omitted in the remake. Some of these iconic scenes, like the infamous laser hall, actually fit better stylistically within the context of Ada's Mission Impossible-esque story. In some ways, this DLC serves as a nice love letter to longtime fans more than the actual remake does because of the inclusion of these scenes.","content_length":1032,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Review - Where Does She Get Those Wonderful Toys?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-separate-ways-dlc-review-where-does-she-get-those-wonderful-toys/1900-6418122/","post_date":"September 27, 2023 at 2:31PM PDT","content":"At times, though, it can also feel heavy-handed, with some moments being reimagined less successfully than others.

This third-person shooter takes inspiration from some of the best in the genre but eschews expectations with a thrilling love story between a vampire and vampire hunter, exploring the complexities of the pairing as the world is crumbling around them. You play as James Savage, a pill-addicted monster hunter living in a secluded hotel in El Paso and on a mission to save the world from his ex-girlfriend, Draculae. This version of the famed vampire has enacted a ritual that brings about the end times. More specifically for Savage, it means a rip through the fabric of reality that sends him from the stained carpets of the motel down a warped void filled with visually diverse levels. At first, El Paso, Elsewhere focuses on Savage, delving into his destructive personality and vices, whether it's popping pain pills or relishing the violence he's engaged in. It takes a while, but eventually the true scope of the story comes into view, with new locales and fourth-wall breaking narration exposing this game's novel take on the mythology behind vampires, and how the relationship between Savage and Janet Drake, known later as Draculae, fits into that. The voice acting for both Savage and Draculae is exceptionally captivating. Their blossoming love is thoughtfully conveyed through audio logs you find throughout your journey, with playful exchanges (like a conversation about how Transformers procreate) doing an excellent job at establishing a relationship you never get to see. Later, when the two characters exchange words directly, the absence of this warmth is noticeable. There's clearly still love between the two, but it's separated by a gap in morality that neither can compromise on. These exchanges are short but sharp, each word a stake one is trying to lay in the other, all the while Savage barely maintains a grip on the enormity of the task waiting for him at the end. It's a compelling dynamic that gets an equally satisfying conclusion, but it is a pity it takes a handful of hours for it to really get going. The core gameplay focus is on getting into a level, shooting as many monsters as possible, potentially saving some hostages, and getting back out through the void-traversing elevator you arrived in. The action is punchy and exhilarating; successive headshots are a delight thanks to the satisfying audio cue for each successful hit, while the liberal slow-motion meter--which is filled with each kill--lets you pull off some satisfying dives and twists in mid-air, firing off accurate shots with the ease of a seasoned killer. The crunch that a stake makes as you drive it into an enemy accentuates the raw power that the wooden weapon contains, dispatching most enemies instantly if you dare get close enough. El Paso, Elsewhere embraces a power fantasy but still presents the right amount of challenge. Guns don't reload automatically, for example, which is a small but profound change after years of muscle memory from most other games. This change also limits how much you can do in a stint of slow-motion, since reloading (and changing weapons) can chew through your meter far too quickly. Knowing when you make a daring dive, which direction to use it in, and ensuring you have the right weapon for the group of enemies you want to dispatch are all factors you need to consider repeatedly, with the steady pace of firefights and variety of enemies keeping the loop continually engaging. This void that you explore gets filled in with locales from the couple's history, as well as memories from throughout their lives, slowly transforming from one to the other in such a delicate fashion that it really helps the theme that Savage is losing his grip on reality. For example, a dark cemetery where Savage shared his first dates with Draculae gets smashed together with a haunting abattoir that recalls a past, traumatic hunt. These combinations are subtle, with one locale slowly giving way to another over the course of a few levels, replicating the confusion that Savage experiences effectively. There's a surprisingly wide range of scenery that is pulled from and used well to keep the otherwise straightforward navigation through each stage fresh and exciting, especially when El Paso, Elsewhere hits a stride in the final third, using level construction and set pieces to really play around delightful with each distinct area type. From its narrative presentation to its gameplay, El Paso, Elsewhere takes inspiration from numerous other narrative-based shooters, stretching back decades up to some more recent releases. The manner in which James Savage narrates the tale, coupled with the somber tone and heavy use of slow-motion diving, will instantly remind you of games such as Max Payne and Stranglehold, while the bold, screen-consuming titles for each stage will have you recalling the distinct usage of the same technique in Remedy's Control. Gallery El Paso, Elsewhere isn't shy about emulating its inspirations, but it isn't wholly defined by them either. It uses these individual elements to bolster its own strong ideas, which give life to levels that are pulsating music videos with evocative rap lyrics, or mind-bending trips through layouts that cascade on themselves as you navigate them passively, focusing on the twisting nature of the stage around you rather than blasting enemies away. From its distinctly retro-style character models to the chunky pickups for ammo and health, El Paso, Elsewhere looks like something you've played before but also won't be mistaken for anything other than itself, which is a difficult balance to strike. Despite taking more time than it should to really hit its stride, El Paso, Elsewhere is unrelenting once it does. Its straightforward action is enhanced by its consistently evolving enemies and delicate balancing of power, while its captivating love story presents a novel take on established mythologies with some impressive performances to back them up. It wears its inspirations on its sleeve but has its own ideas to add to the mix, making El Paso, Elsewhere much more than the sum of its apparent parts.

Because of this, we've decided to share our impressions of Part One and will update it with a full review of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero when both parts are available. The score attached to this review is subject to change based on this. The fan reception to Scarlet and Violet's launch varied wildly within the community. Every Pokemon fan seems to know what's best for the series, and they were happy to share their opinions on Scarlet and Violet with anyone who would listen. Some fans decried the bugs, the struggling frame rate, and other technical problems, while others appreciated the new mechanics, open world, and story enough to make peace with these issues. Whichever side you fell on, the community was split as always. However, the further we get away from release, the more the community cools off. And those who've stuck around for the long-term, namely competitive players, have dug their claws deep into the meta. This is where Pokemon is at its best, and The Teal Mask bolsters that side of the series through new and returning Pokemon, more TMs and moves, and some welcome quality-of-life changes. This is all wrapped up in a rich new region with a heartfelt story. While The Teal Mask doesn't do much to address Scarlet and Violet's poor technical performance, its changes and additions offer an exciting first part in a larger expansion. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

A handful of students are randomly selected to study abroad in a new rural Japan-inspired region called Kitakami. Your character is among the lucky few, and you're whisked away to the countryside. It's a punchy introduction that gets you to the new area quickly and has you catching new and returning Pokemon right away. While Kitakami shares a lot of geographical features with Paldea--rolling green hills, serene lakes adorned with waterfalls, and a rugged mountain fixed in the center of the map--what sets it apart is its rich culture. The folks who call Kitakami home have a deep reverence for the Loyal Three, a trio of legendary Pokemon similar to the legendary birds or dogs from previous generations. As the story goes, the Loyal Three protected the townsfolk from a fearsome ogre. As a student, your assignment is to explore the Kitakami region and piece together the tale of the Loyal Three and the Ogre. It's a simple setup, but it's an effective way to familiarize yourself with the region, its history, and the characters. The heart and soul of The Teal Mask are two of its new characters: Carmine and Keiran. These siblings were born and raised in Kitakami and attend Blueberry Academy (which will be featured more prominently in the second DLC, The Indigo Disk). As you explore the region, they'll color your discoveries with personal experience and local insight. Quickly, you learn that Keiran feels like an outsider and Carmine is competitive to a fault. The story provides an excellent backdrop for both of these characters, particularly Keiran, as his struggle with acceptance mirrors the plight of the Loyal Three and the Ogre. The story builds to a satisfying conclusion that neatly ties things up in the Kitakami region, while also sowing the seeds for the second expansion. It's a touching story that regularly took me by surprise. While Scarlet and Violet's story had some exciting revelations up its sleeve, mainline Pokemon games are often shackled to a handful of recurring tropes: the gym challenge, an evil or misunderstood faction, and a rival. With The Teal Mask, it's refreshing to play a semi-self-contained and condensed story that sheds a lot of those tropes in order to shine a brighter light on its characters. It takes roughly four to five hours to get through, but altogether it took me around 12 hours when factoring in completing the Kitakami Pokedex. Once you've wrapped up the story, there are still reasons to explore Kitakami, including a handful of secrets and a powerful new Pokemon to catch. But as good as its narrative chops are, the biggest draw is the new and returning Pokemon. Dipplin, Sinistcha, and the Loyal Three are creative additions that fit thematically within the region and its culture. Meanwhile, fan favorites like Milotic, Chandelure, and Gliscor are welcome inclusions to Scarlet and Violet's Pokedex. It's hard to say which Pokemon will shake up the competitive scene, but there are a few new and returning moves that could certainly make waves, such as Grassy Glide, Syrup Bomb, and Matcha Gotcha. The added TMs could also make certain Pokemon viable once again. For instance, Scald and Toxic were fairly common on competitive teams of past generations but were missing from Scarlet and Violet at launch. At the very least, EV boosting and resetting items are far more plentiful in Kitakami thanks to the Ogre Oustin' minigame. This makes it much easier for competitors to train up these new and returning Pokemon and put them to the test. Gallery However, the only real test Scarlet and Violet offers are a few tricky trainer battles, none of which consist of double battles. Without a Battle Tower or something similar, this means the only way to put these new and returning Pokemon through the paces is by going online. Online functionality is decent, but it doesn't always provide the best space to test out different strategies and builds. Based on what we know about the second expansion, it sounds like something similar to the Battle Tower could return, but for now, The Scarlet and Violet still feel like they are missing a core component of the endgame experience. The Teal Mask's most apparent flaw is the same one that ultimately held back Scarlet and Violet. The performance and graphical quality are rough. The new region is plagued by low frame rates, poor-looking textures, and visual bugs. If you were hoping that update 2.0.1 might patch those issues, you're out of luck. There are some minor fixes, such as smoother Pokemon Box navigation, but it's hard to appreciate given how subpar the game remains from a technical standpoint. Nailing down my feelings on Pokemon Scarlet and Violet this past year has been difficult. In my review of the base game, I said it was one of \"the best mainline Pokemon games in years,\" and 350 hours later, I still stand by that. Terastallization is the best battle gimmick the series has introduced to date, the open-world design fits nicely into the series' themes of exploration and discovery, and the competitive scene has been a thrill to follow and participate in. However, Scarlet and Violet's triumphant highs are still obscured by technical issues, and the same can be said for The Teal Mask. Scarlet and Violet's core issues still persist, but there's a lot to chew on here, both for hardcore competitive players and fans who want to see more of the Pokemon world.","length":8787,"tokens":1957,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Pokemon Scarlet And Violet - The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero Review In Progress","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero-review-in-progress/1900-6418119/","post_date":"September 21, 2023 at 4:41PM PDT","content":"Editor's Note: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's expansion comes in two parts and can't be purchased individually.

Fans will proclaim that certain sports sim series would be better if only they were up against a similar product when players went looking to buy one. NBA 2K hasn't had a consistent competitor for most of the last decade, and it's been a reliably fun simulation of basketball regardless. That is still largely the case in NBA 2K24, but the eminently enjoyable on-court sim is hampered more than ever by the game's pay-to-win economy. In NBA 2K24, the mainstays of MyCareer, MyTeam, and MyNBA return, and even last year's Jordan Challenge gets a pseudo-sequel in Mamba Moments, shifting the spotlight from the GOAT to Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. But Mamba Moments winds up emblematic of some of 2K24's issues: It's noticeably less interesting and less involved than that which came before it. Maybe some of that is owed to the fact that Bryant's career achievements can't quite stack up to Jordan's, so the figurative ceiling for a mode that lets you recreate some of his greatest career moments isn't going to be nearly as mesmerizing. Mamba Moments is a fun addition to the game, but it can't stack up to last year's Jordan Challenge. But even then, Mamba Moments lacks some of the attention and care this studio normally pours into its new toys. Unlike Jordan Challenge, Mamba Moments doesn't feature interview segments with players, coaches, and broadcasters who were pivotal to each chapter of the Jordan Challenge's story. Bryant's legacy mode doesn't get the same documentary-style treatment, and only about half as many games--seven--are playable this time. That makes it a shorter and less robust mode, though other fun details like era-appropriate presentation and well-researched in-game commentary remain. I was impressed when the color commentators started talking about a travel delay the Lakers suffered due to inclement weather some 20 years ago. As ever, this studio has done its homework, and it shows. In MyNBA, the changes are similarly smaller after last year's big leap. NBA 2K23 introduced Eras, the ability to begin a franchise in previous decades with accurate rosters, rulebooks, and visual filters. NBA 2K24 returns this hopefully permanent element, but merely adds one new starting point: the LeBron Era, which highlights the arrival of NBA superteams like the Miami Heat and all that have followed in the years since. That's a worthwhile gap to fill in, but not as notable as last year's huge introduction of the idea. To be fair, the work that is involved in the Eras feature is unique to this series, and clearly a painstaking process as well as an ultimately rewarding experience for players. Perhaps there's nowhere else to go with the idea, though, which certainly feels true of the best-in-class presentation. NBA 2K has long looked and sounded exactly like a real NBA game in a way no other sports sim really touches. Commentary is full of life and tons of variety, including multiple commentary booths, so you'll hear different voices across different games. The highlight reels, stadium atmospheres, and legitimately funny halftime shows are all remarkable, even if the series feels like it's peaked in this regard. It's an impressively accurate simulation of the way basketball is presented on television, and it's hard for me to find flaws in its approach, even though I'd have said the same thing a few years ago and little has changed in between. Against itself, NBA 2K's presentation can almost be taken for granted because of that. It's not until I jump over to other sports games where I most appreciate how well this studio replicates live basketball. This has never been truer than it is on the court, too. This year, the 2K team is touting technology it calls ProPlay, which somehow--AI is my guess--transposes real-life NBA game footage into animations within NBA 2K24, supplementing motion-captured animations with the real thing. For years, the team has talked about how every basketball player is unique in how they move and play the sport, and why then it's a focus to accurately recreate those individuals when players control them. Given the team hasn't explained in great depth how this feature manages to do that, it's difficult for me to know how much to attribute this game's improved feel to ProPlay versus, say, the usual fine-tuning an annual sports game tends to receive anyway. But whatever the origin may be, it's obvious that this game feels great in my hands. My hope is Eras are permanent in MyNBA mode, even if we can't really expect another playable era until several years from now. When I first started playing, I could sense a difference, but to really qualify it, I played 2K24 side by side with 2K23. I found that it's best felt in how body momentum is simulated. Even as a great sim in its own right, last year's game feels more arcade-like compared to this year's game. Backpedaling on a change of possession, strafing to clamp down on defense, and hitting that extra level on a fast break all now benefit from more fluidity and range, making the shiftiest players stand out even more and giving all players a more lifelike feel on the controller. NBA 2K24 is simply a joy to play on the court. It's an impressive feat given how strong the game already felt to play before, but I liken it to how gamers tend to marvel at visuals and struggle to imagine them ever improving, only for those visuals to blatantly and dramatically improve just a few years later. Maybe in that same light, this team will find new ways to enhance presentation and the Eras features in future years--even if, for now, they've plateaued at an apparent yet impressive summit. However, like most years in recent memory, NBA 2K24 is a great basketball sim being dragged down by its in-game economy. On one hand, this is somewhat partitioned in MyTeam, the game's card-collecting mode that allows players to slowly build (or quickly buy) fantasy teams for use in PvE and PvP modes. It's the latter mode that continues to hurt the game--the genre, really--as the mode is unapologetically pay-to-win. Players who wish to cut the line can usually buy the team they want or something similarly flawless at the cost of their bank account balances. The game's premium versions sold in stores come pre-loaded with tons of Virtual Currency (VC), which can quickly take a team from the mid-60s overall to something in the 80s, circumventing a weeks- or months-long process for a day-one fee. Plenty do this, and they quickly flood the mode with incongruous matchups as a result. Sports games could feasibly separate the spending whales from the free-team players in matchmaking, but then that latter group wouldn't feel the urge to keep up with the Joneses and spend too, nor would the whales enjoy dominating free teams as often as they may. We're left with a lopsided player base that isn't fun, at least as someone unwilling to invest in the mode. While MyTeam Points, the game's formerly strictly earned currency, is now doled more often, that too is for sale for the first time ever, quite comically, giving players yet another way to pay their way to the front of the line and the top of the standings. On top of that, the game introduces a new paid battle pass system that locks away some cards behind a paywall. The first season is also only six weeks long, which is considerably shorter than seasons in many of the other most popular games using battle passes, which tend to cycle through seasons roughly every 8-12 weeks. That means more paid battle passes per year, and more locked-away cards within each of them. NBA 2K is not alone in committing offenses like these, but it may be the worst offender of the sizeable group. In The City, players make purchases, not memories. That's because NBA 2K is uniquely equipped to perform this predatory tactic elsewhere in the game. The City (previously The Neighborhood), the MMO-like social space, has long been the live-service focal point of the game, and it's something no one else in sports gaming is yet able to match. While many players may buy the game only to play MyNBA or another mode, the game's year of updates and attractions are largely built around The City, and the community flocks to it as a result. In 2K24, The City looks like Miami but behaves like a Florida swamp, submerging players in an expensive quagmire of branding opportunities and VC that won't carry them as far as it once did. The prime example of this is in how much VC players need to improve their player. While playing with one's created player across both The City and MyCareer will slowly reward players with VC, the trickle is much too slow for the game's lively community, so many players elect to quickly invest hundreds of thousands of VC, translating to upwards of $100, into their players. In recent years, the game's premium edition included 100,000 VC (about $50 if bought separately) and would get players to jump from a 60 overall to roughly an 84 overall depending on their player and specific build. In NBA 2K24, the same amount of VC only gets players to about 75 overall. That means more real money will be spent by anyone hoping to skip the slow climb toward greatness and jump right into competing in the game's PvP modes like street play and Pro Am. And VC isn't just spent on improving players or fantasy teams. It can also be spent on a long list of in-game branded items from Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, and many others. The City is one part social hub where players complete daily challenges, meet up with friends, and move seamlessly between City activities and MyCareer games. But it remains a dizzying hellscape of in-game advertising, boiling player engagement down into a nightmarish shopping mall where Jake from State Farm is unfathomably your buddy and every building is named after a sports drink or shoe manufacturer.

For many players, everything revolves around their created athlete, and the game has nurtured such a competitive environment that there's increasingly more pressure to stay afloat with in-game spending. A keen fashion sense, while not providing a gameplay advantage, does pluck spending money out of the same pool of VC as the performance-altering boosts and stat bumps, collectively resulting in even more spending for players--and that sadly seems to be the point. For all that spending to not go nearly as far in 2K24 only amplifies the long-standing pay-to-win issues that continue to hold back this series. Without these issues, NBA 2K would be the single best sports game on the market. But its blemishes are not minor. They poison too many parts of the game, especially those that are most important. Pay-to-win problems have reached plague-like proportions in NBA 2K24, and the good things it does don't feel as big or impressive as last year's to make up for them. While interesting iterative improvements can sometimes be greater than the sum of their parts, the in-game economy hampers much of the goodwill that may derive from elsewhere in the game. I shouldn't have to talk about money this much in a basketball game. But in this series, it's become unavoidable. NBA 2K24 feels like a game made by details-obsessed basketball experts unfortunately hamstrung by bottom-line-obsessed executives.","length":12081,"tokens":2678,"chunks":[{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"Some sports game franchises often have their problems attributed to a lack of competition in their respective genres. Fans will proclaim that certain sports sim series would be better if only they were up against a similar product when players went looking to buy one. NBA 2K hasn't had a consistent competitor for most of the last decade, and it's been a reliably fun simulation of basketball regardless. That is still largely the case in NBA 2K24, but the eminently enjoyable on-court sim is hampered more than ever by the game's pay-to-win economy. In NBA 2K24, the mainstays of MyCareer, MyTeam, and MyNBA return, and even last year's Jordan Challenge gets a pseudo-sequel in Mamba Moments, shifting the spotlight from the GOAT to Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. But Mamba Moments winds up emblematic of some of 2K24's issues: It's noticeably less interesting and less involved than that which came before it.","content_length":908,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"Maybe some of that is owed to the fact that Bryant's career achievements can't quite stack up to Jordan's, so the figurative ceiling for a mode that lets you recreate some of his greatest career moments isn't going to be nearly as mesmerizing. Mamba Moments is a fun addition to the game, but it can't stack up to last year's Jordan Challenge. But even then, Mamba Moments lacks some of the attention and care this studio normally pours into its new toys. Unlike Jordan Challenge, Mamba Moments doesn't feature interview segments with players, coaches, and broadcasters who were pivotal to each chapter of the Jordan Challenge's story. Bryant's legacy mode doesn't get the same documentary-style treatment, and only about half as many games--seven--are playable this time. That makes it a shorter and less robust mode, though other fun details like era-appropriate presentation and well-researched in-game commentary remain.","content_length":924,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"I was impressed when the color commentators started talking about a travel delay the Lakers suffered due to inclement weather some 20 years ago. As ever, this studio has done its homework, and it shows. In MyNBA, the changes are similarly smaller after last year's big leap. NBA 2K23 introduced Eras, the ability to begin a franchise in previous decades with accurate rosters, rulebooks, and visual filters. NBA 2K24 returns this hopefully permanent element, but merely adds one new starting point: the LeBron Era, which highlights the arrival of NBA superteams like the Miami Heat and all that have followed in the years since. That's a worthwhile gap to fill in, but not as notable as last year's huge introduction of the idea. To be fair, the work that is involved in the Eras feature is unique to this series, and clearly a painstaking process as well as an ultimately rewarding experience for players.","content_length":906,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"Perhaps there's nowhere else to go with the idea, though, which certainly feels true of the best-in-class presentation. NBA 2K has long looked and sounded exactly like a real NBA game in a way no other sports sim really touches. Commentary is full of life and tons of variety, including multiple commentary booths, so you'll hear different voices across different games. The highlight reels, stadium atmospheres, and legitimately funny halftime shows are all remarkable, even if the series feels like it's peaked in this regard. It's an impressively accurate simulation of the way basketball is presented on television, and it's hard for me to find flaws in its approach, even though I'd have said the same thing a few years ago and little has changed in between. Against itself, NBA 2K's presentation can almost be taken for granted because of that. It's not until I jump over to other sports games where I most appreciate how well this studio replicates live basketball.","content_length":972,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"This has never been truer than it is on the court, too. This year, the 2K team is touting technology it calls ProPlay, which somehow--AI is my guess--transposes real-life NBA game footage into animations within NBA 2K24, supplementing motion-captured animations with the real thing. For years, the team has talked about how every basketball player is unique in how they move and play the sport, and why then it's a focus to accurately recreate those individuals when players control them. Given the team hasn't explained in great depth how this feature manages to do that, it's difficult for me to know how much to attribute this game's improved feel to ProPlay versus, say, the usual fine-tuning an annual sports game tends to receive anyway. But whatever the origin may be, it's obvious that this game feels great in my hands.","content_length":828,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"My hope is Eras are permanent in MyNBA mode, even if we can't really expect another playable era until several years from now. When I first started playing, I could sense a difference, but to really qualify it, I played 2K24 side by side with 2K23. I found that it's best felt in how body momentum is simulated. Even as a great sim in its own right, last year's game feels more arcade-like compared to this year's game. Backpedaling on a change of possession, strafing to clamp down on defense, and hitting that extra level on a fast break all now benefit from more fluidity and range, making the shiftiest players stand out even more and giving all players a more lifelike feel on the controller. NBA 2K24 is simply a joy to play on the court.","content_length":744,"content_tokens":172,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"It's an impressive feat given how strong the game already felt to play before, but I liken it to how gamers tend to marvel at visuals and struggle to imagine them ever improving, only for those visuals to blatantly and dramatically improve just a few years later. Maybe in that same light, this team will find new ways to enhance presentation and the Eras features in future years--even if, for now, they've plateaued at an apparent yet impressive summit. However, like most years in recent memory, NBA 2K24 is a great basketball sim being dragged down by its in-game economy. On one hand, this is somewhat partitioned in MyTeam, the game's card-collecting mode that allows players to slowly build (or quickly buy) fantasy teams for use in PvE and PvP modes. It's the latter mode that continues to hurt the game--the genre, really--as the mode is unapologetically pay-to-win.","content_length":875,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"Players who wish to cut the line can usually buy the team they want or something similarly flawless at the cost of their bank account balances. The game's premium versions sold in stores come pre-loaded with tons of Virtual Currency (VC), which can quickly take a team from the mid-60s overall to something in the 80s, circumventing a weeks- or months-long process for a day-one fee. Plenty do this, and they quickly flood the mode with incongruous matchups as a result. Sports games could feasibly separate the spending whales from the free-team players in matchmaking, but then that latter group wouldn't feel the urge to keep up with the Joneses and spend too, nor would the whales enjoy dominating free teams as often as they may. We're left with a lopsided player base that isn't fun, at least as someone unwilling to invest in the mode.","content_length":842,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"While MyTeam Points, the game's formerly strictly earned currency, is now doled more often, that too is for sale for the first time ever, quite comically, giving players yet another way to pay their way to the front of the line and the top of the standings. On top of that, the game introduces a new paid battle pass system that locks away some cards behind a paywall. The first season is also only six weeks long, which is considerably shorter than seasons in many of the other most popular games using battle passes, which tend to cycle through seasons roughly every 8-12 weeks. That means more paid battle passes per year, and more locked-away cards within each of them. NBA 2K is not alone in committing offenses like these, but it may be the worst offender of the sizeable group. In The City, players make purchases, not memories. That's because NBA 2K is uniquely equipped to perform this predatory tactic elsewhere in the game.","content_length":934,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"The City (previously The Neighborhood), the MMO-like social space, has long been the live-service focal point of the game, and it's something no one else in sports gaming is yet able to match. While many players may buy the game only to play MyNBA or another mode, the game's year of updates and attractions are largely built around The City, and the community flocks to it as a result. In 2K24, The City looks like Miami but behaves like a Florida swamp, submerging players in an expensive quagmire of branding opportunities and VC that won't carry them as far as it once did. The prime example of this is in how much VC players need to improve their player.","content_length":659,"content_tokens":146,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"While playing with one's created player across both The City and MyCareer will slowly reward players with VC, the trickle is much too slow for the game's lively community, so many players elect to quickly invest hundreds of thousands of VC, translating to upwards of $100, into their players. In recent years, the game's premium edition included 100,000 VC (about $50 if bought separately) and would get players to jump from a 60 overall to roughly an 84 overall depending on their player and specific build. In NBA 2K24, the same amount of VC only gets players to about 75 overall. That means more real money will be spent by anyone hoping to skip the slow climb toward greatness and jump right into competing in the game's PvP modes like street play and Pro Am. And VC isn't just spent on improving players or fantasy teams. It can also be spent on a long list of in-game branded items from Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, and many others.","content_length":937,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"NBA 2K24 Review - Breaking Ankles, Breaking Banks","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k24-review-breaking-ankles-breaking-banks/1900-6418117/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 10:18AM PDT","content":"The City is one part social hub where players complete daily challenges, meet up with friends, and move seamlessly between City activities and MyCareer games.

Within that were tragic, human stories to pull at your heartstrings and a whole lot of violent action often perpetuated by its gameplay systems. But what if you took the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 and condensed them into a tight, cohesive package for a heart-wrenching political action thriller? That's what Phantom Liberty does in an expansion that seamlessly fits into the original game. Phantom Liberty showcases the full potential of Cyberpunk 2077 with a new, captivating story about the faults of loyalty, reckoning with your past and its consequences, and self-preservation in a tech-fueled dystopia. These are familiar themes, for sure, but Phantom Liberty is intimate, raw, and earnest--all told through the lens of a strong cast of characters elevated by poignant writing and delivered through sharp performances. It's able to execute on these narrative ambitions because, more often than not, the missions that drive the plot feature top-tier action set pieces that let the revamped RPG mechanics sing, then break the pace with a variety of tense and well-crafted non-combat scenarios, which gives the experience a constant and steady momentum. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

It's a fantastic mix of nearly everything you could ask of Cyberpunk. And after taking 30 hours to experience all of its content--both main story routes, the new ending, all the side missions and gigs, and more--I can't imagine Cyberpunk 2077 without Phantom Liberty. While you can jump straight into the new content or use a save far enough in the base game, those starting fresh will have to make it to what's roughly the halfway point, right when the original story gives you parallel main questlines. Phantom Liberty acts as another branch to main character V's search for a cure to their disease, and one that involves forces outside of Night City: federal agents who make up the new core characters, and Dogtown, a downtrodden militia-run district where most of the expansion takes place. It's hard to ignore the starpower of famed actor Idris Elba, who lends his voice and likeness to key character Solomon Reed. He's stubborn and keeps everyone at arm's length, yet has a commanding presence in every scene he's in. But the emotional anchor is Song So Mi, aka Songbird, who's arguably the most talented netrunner in the world. Sharing the same goals as V, she provides a wonderful contrast and brings the depth required to tell a story like Phantom Liberty's. Reed and Songbird have a deep history working together as long-time FIA agents, and with V caught up in all of it, an intriguing tension constantly hangs over the political and personal drama. And there to cut the tension is Johnny Silverhand, who's still the charismatic asshole you know and love, portrayed by and modeled after Keanu Reeves once again. Surprisingly, he gets a lot more introspective, opening up in ways that add a new dimension to his character as he relates to the events of Phantom Liberty. He's always lingering in the background and often provides sobering perspectives on the most dire situations while staying true to who he is--there's a comforting familiarity when he pops up. When you don't know who to trust or what choice to make, you can rely on Johnny to be that dickhead friend you can't help but love because, with each of his smartass one-liners, you at least know he's brutally honest. Voice performances come alive with motion capture and animation, which benefits scenes where subtleties genuinely add a layer of nuance to these characters. Especially for a story entirely told in first-person, those high production values pay off. This confluence of writing, performance, and tech is how Reed, Songbird, Johnny, and other supporting characters are able to jump out from the screen as memorable in their most critical moments, and become unforgettable figures in Cyberpunk's world. The new physical piece to that world is Dogtown, an independent district within Night City that's been overrun by a militia acting as the de facto government. Sprawling slums and abandoned buildings make up most of Dogtown, along with a few luxurious establishments and the lively black market within the football stadium. It's smaller in scale than the main Night City map, making it easier to familiarize yourself with the streets. But when looking across the district from the rooftops, it still gives the impression of an expansive open world. Although the harsh realities on the ground are sad to see, like a post-apocalyptic society barely scraping by, Dogtown has a distinct identity separate from Night City. Part of it is a lawless warzone, but there's another side that's genuinely human with people trying their best to eke out an existence in spite of it all. Phantom Liberty makes great use of Dogtown, smartly embedding much of its main story and side missions within its streets. The absolute banger of an opening mission is emblematic of this design philosophy. As Songbird leads you through the stadium's black market, you get an immediate sense of the town's vibe before all hell breaks loose. Whether you're wading through battling factions in tense firefights or making elaborate plays at stealth, you can quickly see how Dogtown was made to naturally support a variety of missions and combat sequences that feel curated and intentionally designed, and that synergy is a mark of a good open world. Gigs and side missions also litter the streets, and Phantom Liberty prioritizes quality over quantity here as well. While they are side content, gigs play an important role in the flow of the main mission since your fixer, Mr. Hands, is a crucial contact for favors that advance the story. What's more is that each gig is an elaborately designed mission rather than an objective to check off a list. These are action-packed to give them a satisfying gameplay challenge, and they're always accompanied by a heavy decision in the end, which needs to often be made in the heat of the moment. With only incomplete information of the situation at hand, the moral conundrums become more interesting as choices are rarely ever black and white. These stories paint a vivid picture of what life is like in Dogtown, where the desperation to escape poverty clashes with the very system that people rely on; a system that exploits them, grinds them, and spits them out. The results of your decisions may not lead to major revelations, but every single gig and side mission is absolutely worth doing.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Phantom Liberty also encompasses the 2.0 update for Cyberpunk, and the combat is now more exciting with explosive set pieces that bring out the best in the overhauled RPG systems. (You can read my full thoughts on the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update specifically, if you want all the details.) With the revamped perks and skill trees, building your character for specific playstyles can lead to dramatic effectiveness in combat. And the flexibility of the system, which expertly balances complexity and approachability, means you'll create hybrid approaches. Features like the Hack Queue make netrunner-style builds much more practical and intricate. Lightning-fast air dashes combined with blades make you a nimble, lethal target who can deflect bullets back at enemies. Stealth can also be worked into any build because the gameplay systems and level design both support it as a viable option. Cyberpunk isn't rigid, and in fact, it pushes you to create these hybrid builds to overcome Phantom Liberty's intense, challenging battles. The distinct abilities in the skill trees are so fun to mix and match, and like great RPGs do, allowing players to piece together their favorite gameplay mechanics feels natural. The new cyberware system adds another layer to creating an effective build, letting you fine-tune your character with specific stat buffs, additional abilities, and quickhacks. Phantom Liberty introduces the Relic skill tree as well, and while it isn't particularly deep, it adds a wrinkle to the formula with new cyberware like the quickhack-infused Monowire melee weapon, or additional perks that give an upper hand for stealth or hitting enemy weak spots. Cyberpunk 2077's RPG identity is much stronger now than it was previously and Phantom Liberty's combat scenarios substantially benefit from this reinvented foundation. Together, it all results in a uniquely satisfying gameplay experience. There was never a dull moment when it came to combat, but it's only one part of what Phantom Liberty does so well. The story draws inspiration from spy thrillers, which is easily seen in missions where you have to navigate conversations carefully under stressful situations. Infiltrating an extravagant rooftop party, then blending in as guest in order to make contact and get vital information, was a definite highlight--due in part to the lifelike atmosphere and intoxicating visual flourishes. When it came down to business, however, making sensible dialogue decisions under duress, and often doubting yourself if you made the right one, was integral to the experience. Overall, Phantom Liberty isn't so much concerned with giving you freedom to influence outcomes on a large scale until it makes those choices clear. But even when it's on a set track with clear paths, the game is great at contextualizing your decisions to mitigate feelings of pointlessness. There are some inconsistencies in dialogue options and a few cases where I'm conflicted not with the choices I made, but in how certain characters portray specific situations and the tone they're delivered in. But otherwise, the writing is watertight and I began to care about those minor decisions as I became fully invested in the story and playing the role of my V, even if just to provoke certain responses. The conversations at Dogtown's park overlooking the unfinished skyscrapers give you time to soak it all in. Sticking around to eavesdrop on a conversation between key characters or make a dialogue choice opens small, but rewarding opportunities to see characters in a different light. So, as wild as the action may get, there's an ever-present groundedness to the journey, making seemingly inconsequential choices add up to form a believable, personalized understanding of Phantom Liberty.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194843-phantomliberty2. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4194843-phantomliberty2. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194843-phantomliberty2. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4194843-phantomliberty2. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">With all that laid bare, Phantom Liberty's crowning achievement is in how it executes its closing hours.

They'll hit you with unexpected twists that leave you questioning whether or not you did the right thing, wondering why you feel empowered yet powerless, and pondering the age-old question: What was it all for? This is one case where I implore anyone who plays this expansion to see both routes. This is because of the drastically different and superb gameplay sequences they offer, even subverting the genre expectations in one case, but more importantly, together they complete the full picture of Phantom Liberty's ambitious story. And on top of that, the new ending for the original story earned by fulfilling certain conditions in Phantom Liberty is a cherry on top, recontextualizing the Cyberpunk journey in powerful fashion. To talk about the emotions it teased out of me would be to give away too much--but I must say that CD Projekt Red has outdone itself with this one, delivering the type of ending that very few games are able to get right. Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best. CD Projekt Red has taken the lessons from the original release and focused on the parts that mattered most to deliver a thrilling and impactful experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. And although it fits into the original story, it leaves a lasting impact that rewrote my perception of Cyberpunk's world. From a gameplay perspective, Phantom Liberty takes full advantage of the fantastic overhaul of the RPG systems for combat, then elevates the intimate dialogue-driven elements that make it unforgettable--and does so in spectacular and inventive fashion in its conclusions. Beneath the violence and edginess, the actual cyberpunk world is always going to be about the toll on human life, and Phantom Liberty largely understands that. It's cruel, sobering, and bittersweet, and it'll stick with you well after V lays down their weapons.","length":15658,"tokens":3485,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"The appeal of Night City was in its impressive scope and dazzling visuals, which painted a bleak neon-lit future dictated by technological exploitation and unfettered capitalism. Within that were tragic, human stories to pull at your heartstrings and a whole lot of violent action often perpetuated by its gameplay systems. But what if you took the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 and condensed them into a tight, cohesive package for a heart-wrenching political action thriller? That's what Phantom Liberty does in an expansion that seamlessly fits into the original game. Phantom Liberty showcases the full potential of Cyberpunk 2077 with a new, captivating story about the faults of loyalty, reckoning with your past and its consequences, and self-preservation in a tech-fueled dystopia. These are familiar themes, for sure, but Phantom Liberty is intimate, raw, and earnest--all told through the lens of a strong cast of characters elevated by poignant writing and delivered through sharp performances. It's able to execute on these narrative ambitions because, more often than not, the missions that drive the plot feature top-tier action set pieces that let the revamped RPG mechanics sing, then break the pace with a variety of tense and well-crafted non-combat scenarios, which gives the experience a constant and steady momentum.","content_length":1335,"content_tokens":261,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

And after taking 30 hours to experience all of its content--both main story routes, the new ending, all the side missions and gigs, and more--I can't imagine Cyberpunk 2077 without Phantom Liberty. While you can jump straight into the new content or use a save far enough in the base game, those starting fresh will have to make it to what's roughly the halfway point, right when the original story gives you parallel main questlines. Phantom Liberty acts as another branch to main character V's search for a cure to their disease, and one that involves forces outside of Night City: federal agents who make up the new core characters, and Dogtown, a downtrodden militia-run district where most of the expansion takes place. It's hard to ignore the starpower of famed actor Idris Elba, who lends his voice and likeness to key character Solomon Reed.","content_length":919,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"He's stubborn and keeps everyone at arm's length, yet has a commanding presence in every scene he's in. But the emotional anchor is Song So Mi, aka Songbird, who's arguably the most talented netrunner in the world. Sharing the same goals as V, she provides a wonderful contrast and brings the depth required to tell a story like Phantom Liberty's. Reed and Songbird have a deep history working together as long-time FIA agents, and with V caught up in all of it, an intriguing tension constantly hangs over the political and personal drama. And there to cut the tension is Johnny Silverhand, who's still the charismatic asshole you know and love, portrayed by and modeled after Keanu Reeves once again. Surprisingly, he gets a lot more introspective, opening up in ways that add a new dimension to his character as he relates to the events of Phantom Liberty.","content_length":859,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"He's always lingering in the background and often provides sobering perspectives on the most dire situations while staying true to who he is--there's a comforting familiarity when he pops up. When you don't know who to trust or what choice to make, you can rely on Johnny to be that dickhead friend you can't help but love because, with each of his smartass one-liners, you at least know he's brutally honest. Voice performances come alive with motion capture and animation, which benefits scenes where subtleties genuinely add a layer of nuance to these characters. Especially for a story entirely told in first-person, those high production values pay off. This confluence of writing, performance, and tech is how Reed, Songbird, Johnny, and other supporting characters are able to jump out from the screen as memorable in their most critical moments, and become unforgettable figures in Cyberpunk's world.","content_length":908,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"The new physical piece to that world is Dogtown, an independent district within Night City that's been overrun by a militia acting as the de facto government. Sprawling slums and abandoned buildings make up most of Dogtown, along with a few luxurious establishments and the lively black market within the football stadium. It's smaller in scale than the main Night City map, making it easier to familiarize yourself with the streets. But when looking across the district from the rooftops, it still gives the impression of an expansive open world. Although the harsh realities on the ground are sad to see, like a post-apocalyptic society barely scraping by, Dogtown has a distinct identity separate from Night City. Part of it is a lawless warzone, but there's another side that's genuinely human with people trying their best to eke out an existence in spite of it all.","content_length":871,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Phantom Liberty makes great use of Dogtown, smartly embedding much of its main story and side missions within its streets. The absolute banger of an opening mission is emblematic of this design philosophy. As Songbird leads you through the stadium's black market, you get an immediate sense of the town's vibe before all hell breaks loose. Whether you're wading through battling factions in tense firefights or making elaborate plays at stealth, you can quickly see how Dogtown was made to naturally support a variety of missions and combat sequences that feel curated and intentionally designed, and that synergy is a mark of a good open world. Gigs and side missions also litter the streets, and Phantom Liberty prioritizes quality over quantity here as well. While they are side content, gigs play an important role in the flow of the main mission since your fixer, Mr. Hands, is a crucial contact for favors that advance the story.","content_length":935,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"What's more is that each gig is an elaborately designed mission rather than an objective to check off a list. These are action-packed to give them a satisfying gameplay challenge, and they're always accompanied by a heavy decision in the end, which needs to often be made in the heat of the moment. With only incomplete information of the situation at hand, the moral conundrums become more interesting as choices are rarely ever black and white. These stories paint a vivid picture of what life is like in Dogtown, where the desperation to escape poverty clashes with the very system that people rely on; a system that exploits them, grinds them, and spits them out. The results of your decisions may not lead to major revelations, but every single gig and side mission is absolutely worth doing.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot.","content_length":855,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819.","content_length":445,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review - The Songbird Sings","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/","post_date":"September 20, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Phantom Liberty also encompasses the 2.0 update for Cyberpunk, and the combat is now more exciting with explosive set pieces that bring out the best in the overhauled RPG systems.

As the game is positioned as the franchise's second lore restart in 12 years, the team had to find ways to make this new era of Mortal Kombat feel as fresh and new as the storyline demanded, all while maintaining the high bar of quality the fanbase has come to expect over the series' 30-year lifespan. Mortal Kombat 1 mostly accomplishes this goal through fun new mechanics and an unpredictable storyline, but the overall package lacks the depth needed to make this a masterpiece. Mortal Kombat 1 picks up right where MK11 Aftermath left off, with Liu Kang ascending to godhood. As the Keeper Of Time, he is able to create a new universe as he sees fit, and his creation puts familiar faces on new and interesting paths. Raiden, for instance, is no longer the all-powerful Thunder God; instead, he is a simple farmer from a small village. Every character sees some kind of fundamental change, though some are less noticeable than others. This results in a playable roster that features only returning characters from the series' past; there's not a single brand-new fighter to be seen. However, because of the game's narrative focus, each character feels like they're new--or at the very least has some new elements to their style--which creates the sense of discovery normally reserved for brand-new faces. MK1 takes existing names and reinvents them and it's a novel idea that works really well across the majority of the characters, though some don't feel as revolutionary as they could have. Reptile is a perfect example of a character who has changed for the better. He's still a green-clad ninja with acid spit and the ability to cloak himself, but here he leans much more heavily into his Zaterran shape-shifting abilities. The result is a marvel of animation, as he zips back and forth between the two forms at will without the game missing a beat. Conversely, Reiko--who has only appeared twice before this--is simply a strong soldier type with grapples incorporated into his moveset. It's not a bad choice, and his moves serve him well, but there aren't enough changes in his character to make him as interesting as other members of the cast. With the story changes come new and exciting gameplay mechanics, with aerial combos being one of the smartest. Not only do combos look flashier in the air, but the variety of options stemming from this new addition offer a new kind of excitement that recent MK games lacked. Some characters have ways to chain multiple air combos together, which result in massive damage while looking cool as hell. It's the kind of mechanic that encourages players to work on their timing, as pulling off one of these is not just effective, but it feels really cool, too. A big returning feature are the bloody, gory hallmarks of the franchise: Fatalities. The trademark finishing moves are as disgusting as ever thanks to a combination of creative killing and all-too-realistic sound effects. A few of them shocked me, and I have a higher tolerance than most for gory stuff like this. Brutalities also return, and they function exactly the same way they did before, serving as surprise end-of-match exclamation points covered in blood. This may be a new beginning for Mortal Kombat, but it still plays the classics bloody brilliantly. The biggest new addition to MK1's combat is the Kameo assist mechanic. After I select one of the 23 playable characters, I can choose from a separate roster of fighters who act simply as extra assist characters. Most of these are characters who don't appear on the playable roster, though a few are alternate versions of playable fighters. Once a Kameo is selected, I have three additional attacks at my disposal that I can summon at any time. Kameos can help extend combos, counter enemy attacks, or provide extra mobility in a pinch. Unlike normal abilities or combos, Kameos operate on a cooldown. This ensures each Kameo activation feels important and like a real tactical consideration; considering how versatile some of these attacks are, unlimited access to them would break the game. Motaro, for example, can produce a shield to block attacks as well teleport a character around the stage. Spamming either of those abilities would make fighting against him impossible, but thanks to the cooldown, that's not a problem. Kameos are an ingenious way to include characters in the game who wouldn't have been included otherwise. Seeing faces like Sareena on-screen, even in this limited capacity, is really cool, as she has a legion of fans who have requested to see her again for years. While it's not a fully realized character, it is an acknowledgement of her existence, and it gives me hope that more unsung heroes and villains might again see the light of day. I also love some Kameos being old-school versions of playable characters, with Sub-Zero and Scorpion being prime examples. Kameos add a fun new layer of strategy to the fighting mechanics, while also serving up some grade-A fan service with long-dormant characters. Nearly every character in the game--playable or Kameo--is backed by amazing voice work, with most of the chosen talent oozing personality, toughness, and grit from every spoken word. One major exception, unfortunately, is the most high-profile actress in the game: Megan Fox. I do not deny she is an accomplished actress, but there is a definite difference between her voiced lines and the rest of the cast. Every word she speaks is drab and monotone, and it sounds completely out of place from the rest of the cast. In battle, it's easy to ignore--partially because someone else recorded Nitara's grunts and attack sounds--but in the campaign she sticks out like a sore thumb. I appreciate the idea of a high-profile actress coming into this blockbuster video game--especially one known for being a vampire in a movie and also having a general… vampiric vibe--but Nitara would have been better served with a voiceover that fell in line with the rest of the group--especially when NetherRealm fell into a similar trap after Ronda Rousey's performance as Sonya Blade in MK11. The story of Mortal Kombat 1 is a fun, twisting, and unpredictable tale which culminates with some of the wildest moments in franchise history. Some story beats are ripped right from Mortal Kombat history, as a tip of the hat to those who have stuck around for all 30 years of MK's existence. Others are simply chaos in the best way; I shouted in glee multiple times during the final chapter of the campaign, particularly in one scene which I wish was double its actual length. The decision to develop characters in all-new ways through the story is bold and works wonders. I particularly like how it explores these new approaches through character interaction, like the dynamic between Kitana and Mileena, or the choice to turn Tarkatans like Baraka from a race of savages to normal Outworlders afflicted with a debilitating disease. These new ideas ground what is otherwise a fantastical story of magic and alternate realms with a minor dose of reality, which give each scene more emotional weight. That said, the campaign is not perfect. A few decisions stick in my craw the more I dwell on them, and one major example is what was done with Ermac. Without delving too much into spoiler territory, Ermac's whole \"I'm a being filled with multiple souls\" vibe receives a new wrinkle that, frankly, erases everything that was cool about him. Not only does it happen out of nowhere with little explanation--the reason this change occurs is a head scratcher--but it sticks around for the remainder of the story. It feels like this decision was made simply to give longtime fans something to chew on, but in the process it broke my immersion in the story for a while. The campaign generally does a great job of changing this world, but a few of those changes dull the affected character's impact rather than improve it. There is one caveat to this campaign, and that's its linear nature: Once it's over, there's nothing else to be done. The final chapter does offer some variety, as you're allowed to choose your fighter and the choice in turn changes a few things about the final battle, but that's the only change. Also, that's the only choice the campaign gives you, as unlike in the previous game, you're assigned a character in each chapter rather than having some choices. Luckily, the story is good enough to make up for these shortcomings, but there's still virtually no replayability outside of the last chapter. There are other ways to play Mortal Kombat 1 outside of the excellent campaign mode, and while these modes are fun, they don't offer the same level of interesting gameplay throughout. Online modes included ranked, casual, and private rooms with a \"winner stays on\" format called King Of The Hill. I encountered very little stuttering in my online matches, which is another feather in the cap of rollback netcode. However, the lack of spectator mode in private rooms is a major step back from other fighters. Single-player modes include the traditional towers of Arcade mode, complete with each character receiving an individual ending, and a brand-new mode called Invasion. The classic Towers feel like old-school MK in the arcades, and ascending through them still feels great. Individual character endings are short vignettes as they were in MK11, but the extra lore padding they do offers some interesting potential threads for the future. Smoke's ending, in particular, answered one of my personal burning questions about MK1 quite nicely. Invasions, meanwhile, take place across overworld maps with players running from one objective to the next. The idea is sound, and like the campaign there's plenty of nostalgia to be had--the security code to Cage's mansion, for instance, is \"ABACABB,\" aka the code to enable blood in the Sega Genesis version of the original MK, which is a nice touch. Gallery However, most \"stages\" on these maps contain a single one-round fight, which means that the majority of the stages can be completed in 10-15 seconds. There are modifiers in some matches, like the occasional extra obstacle thrown at me, but they don't do much to enhance the experience. There's very little challenge here, particularly in later areas when I've been able to gain powerful Talismans and Relics to enhance my abilities, and it starts to feel like a grind. Compared to MK11's offerings--the Krypt, which was a sprawling dungeon packed with unlockables and hidden secrets, and the Towers Of Time, which offered new ideas for the classic tower format--Invasions seems like a letdown. There's some fun to be had, but the grindy feeling and lack of variety in the matches make this mode feel less impactful from those of its predecessor. There is a lot to enjoy about this new era of NetherRealm's top fighting game. Mortal Kombat 1 casts a much-needed set of fresh eyes across its lore, which reinvents the roster in new and interesting ways. Not every choice works, both in character design and development, but the ones that do make an immediate impact. Fighting with these new characters is awesome thanks to air combos and Kameos, even if the modes outside of campaign leave something to be desired. The future of Mortal Kombat is bright, and MK1 marks the first step on that new path. I just hope the next chapter gives me more to sink my teeth into.","length":11438,"tokens":2397,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Mortal Kombat 1 Review - New Era, Familiar Kombat","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-1-review-new-era-familiar-kombat/1900-6418115/","post_date":"September 19, 2023 at 11:40AM PDT","content":"NetherRealm Studios had a tall order to fill with Mortal Kombat 1. As the game is positioned as the franchise's second lore restart in 12 years, the team had to find ways to make this new era of Mortal Kombat feel as fresh and new as the storyline demanded, all while maintaining the high bar of quality the fanbase has come to expect over the series' 30-year lifespan. Mortal Kombat 1 mostly accomplishes this goal through fun new mechanics and an unpredictable storyline, but the overall package lacks the depth needed to make this a masterpiece. Mortal Kombat 1 picks up right where MK11 Aftermath left off, with Liu Kang ascending to godhood. As the Keeper Of Time, he is able to create a new universe as he sees fit, and his creation puts familiar faces on new and interesting paths. Raiden, for instance, is no longer the all-powerful Thunder God; instead, he is a simple farmer from a small village.","content_length":906,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Mortal Kombat 1 Review - New Era, Familiar Kombat","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-1-review-new-era-familiar-kombat/1900-6418115/","post_date":"September 19, 2023 at 11:40AM PDT","content":"Every character sees some kind of fundamental change, though some are less noticeable than others.

MK1 takes existing names and reinvents them and it's a novel idea that works really well across the majority of the characters, though some don't feel as revolutionary as they could have.

Developed by South Korean studio Neowiz Games, Lies of P presents a very loose retelling of Italian author Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio. This grim reimagining, combined with a striking Belle Epoque-infused setting, ensures that Lies of P's aesthetic stands apart from other Souls-likes, including From Software's own. Bloodborne is still a clear inspiration, as its tonal atmosphere and combat design call to mind the cosmic horror masterpiece, leading to it feeling overly derivative at times. Still, Neowiz also implements just enough originality for Lies of P to eke out its own identity, even if it's as thin as a puppet string. The story sees you take on the role of P, a lifelike puppet who wakes up amidst the carnage of a puppet-led invasion of the fictional city of Krat. If you're familiar with Pinocchio, you'll likely recognize character names such as the puppet-maker Geppetto and the talking cricket Gemini. Their names are usually where the similarities end, however--either in relation to the book or any Disney-produced retellings. For one, Gemini isn't an anthropomorphic insect but rather a tiny puppet caged in a lantern on P's belt, acting as both a guide and source of light. Similarly, characters like the Fox, Cat, and Alidoro are reimagined as common criminals and thieves, who don their respective animal masks in order to achieve both anonymity and infamy. It's this unique take on a familiar tale that makes Lies of P such an intriguing proposition, so it's hard not to feel disappointed when the story doesn't kick into gear until close to its final act. For the most part, you're tasked with visiting various locations where you'll need to either rescue someone or defeat a specific enemy before returning to the game's central hub. Without an overarching goal to propel you forward, it feels unfocused and only attains a sense of momentum in its final few hours once the antagonist reveals themself. There's very little to latch onto before this point, outside of a curiosity to see where the narrative could potentially go. It's not a case where the game is holding back and being intentionally opaque either. The story is predominantly told via expositional dumps and there's little sense of mystery as a result. There are interesting moments dotted throughout but they're fleeting, and I don't think it's too harsh to expect more considering the source material. Lies of P also features a morality system that occasionally asks you to make a choice between two options: Tell the truth or lie. Puppets can't lie--it's baked into their programming--but as we all know, Pinocchio is special in this regard. The lies you tell are almost never hurtful or deceitful; you lie to provide comfort rather than confront someone with an uncomfortable truth. One such example lets you ease a dying mother's worry by telling her that her (dead) child is still alive and well, so these choices aren't particularly difficult to make. The decision you choose will mostly depend on which branching path you're eager to see play out. Every time you lie, P's springs react--he becomes more human--so I exclusively lied throughout my playthrough to see what effect this would have on either the story or gameplay. I won't spoil the changes I encountered but overall the mechanic didn't feel well used. Neowiz says there are three different endings to unlock, which are affected in some way by how honest you are, but aside from attaining different rewards, it's tough to say how much of the game is impacted by your choices without replaying the whole thing again. Nevertheless, the morality system and the story's shortcomings are lessened somewhat by Lies of P's setting and fantastic sense of place. Each location you visit is sprinkled with interesting lore and visual storytelling, and the game's art design and foreboding atmosphere combine to give the city of Krat an unmistakable personality. The prospect of venturing further into its haunting bowels was all the motivation I needed to push on. Krat's Belle Epoque-era aesthetic is immediately evocative of 19th-century France, right down to the snippets of Bal-musette music that still linger, like echoes of the city's former glory. Back before the events of the game, Krat was a city of marvels. The invention of animatronic puppets gave rise to a period of prosperity that's evident throughout, as Neowiz meshes its historical setting with notable steampunk flourishes. After flying too close to the sun, however, the city's affluence has been shattered by what survivors are calling The Puppet Frenzy. This mysterious affliction has turned the once-docile puppets against the city's denizens in violent fashion. Blood-stained bodies now litter the cobblestone streets, while bags of luggage are strewn next to carriages and across train platforms as evidence of those trying to escape the fallen metropolis. Gaslit street lamps and glaring signs for theater productions cast light on the gloomy aftermath, as twitchy, clockwork puppets emerge from the shadows wielding battered stop signs and candelabras as makeshift weapons. Lies of P oozes atmosphere at nearly every turn, whether you're traversing through Krat's bleeding heart or wading through the ominous forests and scrap yards on its outskirts. The striking visuals aren't just for show either, as it's melded into excellent level design that adopts the strongest aspects of the genre. There's obvious care and attention put into enemy variety and placement, and locations tend to corkscrew back on themselves, rewarding your exploration with vital shortcuts via ladders and unlocked doors. Neowiz also implements just enough originality for Lies of P to eke out its own identityLies of P's basic framework is also familiar, latching onto many of the genre's long-standing hallmarks. Stargazers act as Bonfires; Ergo is an upgrade resource you attain by defeating enemies; you lose Ergo when you die, unless you're able to return to the site of your demise and reclaim it; the leveling system is stat-based, which has an additional impact on weapon buffs; and Neowiz even has a penchant for bombarding you with giant rolling balls, turning any incline into a potential threat. Combat, meanwhile, shares a number of elements in common with Bloodborne. Encounters are fast-paced and emphasize being active and pushing the advantage. You can block attacks, which chips away at both your stamina and health bar, but immediately retaliating lets you regain your lost health. This quickly establishes that it pays to be aggressive, even if you initially adopt a defensive front. Parrying incoming attacks is more effective, however, since it negates all incoming damage, but doing so is much harder to consistently pull off. The timing window is strict and demands that you learn an enemy's attack patterns and cadence, especially when facing one of the game's fearsome bosses. It's worth achieving some level of proficiency, though, because perfect parries also inflict break damage, sending enemies into a staggered state that leaves them open to a deadly critical strike. Timing, rather than positioning, is key to staying alive, yet this approach turns most encounters--but especially boss fights--into lessons in pattern-learning. The enemies you come up against enjoy messing with your rhythm, hesitating for what feels like a second too long on overhand swings, or throwing in an unexpected attack at the end of a combo. This presents a fun challenge but does feel a tad rigid. Nailing a perfectly timed parry is immensely satisfying, though, with each successful block producing an outpouring of incandescent sparks. Combat, in general, is thrilling throughout. Weapons feel weighty and collide with a delightful thud, discharging a gush of oil that covers P from head to toe. It's punishing as well, to the point where even the lowliest enemies can send you to an early grave if you're not focused. However, the difficulty curve never falls into the trap of feeling unfair. Its challenge increases gradually and I can't say I ever encountered any moments where it felt too easy or too difficult, even if a few bosses stumped me for lengthy periods. From a gameplay perspective, Lies of P is a Souls-like in the purest sense, and an accomplished one at that. Unlike the city's other puppets, which are typically designed with specific functions in mind--think maids, police officers, and miners--P is malleable and can be tinkered with. His left arm, for instance, is home to a variety of secondary weapons, from a Scorpion-esque grappling hook to a mine launcher and flamethrower--fulfilling a similar purpose as Sekiro's prosthetic arm. This system is limiting, to a certain extent, since you can only switch between your various arms when resting at a checkpoint, and while it doesn't allow for the same variety of build options as a From Software game, each one adds a small measure of customization to the game. Despite this, you're still given a healthy degree of freedom when it comes to picking a weapon. Each weapon in the game--with the exception of those acquired from fallen bosses--consists of two distinct components: the head and the handle. The head can be anything from an exploding pickaxe to a saber blade, and this dictates the weapon's attack and guard attributes as well. Meanwhile, the handle affects the weapon's stat-scaling and move set. By using the weapon assembly feature, you can mix and match these two components to create a plethora of unique killing tools. Gallery Maybe you'll transform a halberd from a thrusting weapon to a slashing weapon, or alter a strength-based weapon so that it scales with dexterity. Both the head and handle of each weapon also contain a disparate Fable Art--special attacks you can unleash after building up enough Fable energy by damaging opponents. Fable Arts can take the form of a single devastating maneuver, a flurry of consecutive strikes, or even bolster your defensive capabilities for a short while. Being able to pair different Fable Arts adds another layer of flexibility to the weapon assembly system's near-limitless variety. There are a few other specks of originality sprinkled in. When you die and lose your Ergo, for instance, the amount left diminishes each time you sustain damage when attempting to retrieve it. This isn't a massive change, but it adds some extra tension to those moments when you're forced to carefully retrace your steps. For the most part, however, Lies of P is content to adorn existing mechanics and ideas with its own story and aesthetic. This may be a derivative approach, but it nails the core Souls-like experience, with each of its various mechanics seamlessly coalescing to create a thrilling action game that's challenging, varied, and dripping with atmosphere. It's easy to be reductive when a game wears its influences on its sleeve as boldly as Lies of P does, but plenty of other games have tried and failed to recreate the same magic. It's not an easy endeavor, and while it doesn't shake up the formula or reinvent the wheel, Lies of P is still one of the genre's most accomplished and enjoyable entries--and that's the truth.","length":11362,"tokens":2358,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"There's no shortage of Souls-likes vying for our attention, but only one can claim to put a dark and twisted spin on the everlasting story of Pinocchio. Developed by South Korean studio Neowiz Games, Lies of P presents a very loose retelling of Italian author Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio. This grim reimagining, combined with a striking Belle Epoque-infused setting, ensures that Lies of P's aesthetic stands apart from other Souls-likes, including From Software's own. Bloodborne is still a clear inspiration, as its tonal atmosphere and combat design call to mind the cosmic horror masterpiece, leading to it feeling overly derivative at times. Still, Neowiz also implements just enough originality for Lies of P to eke out its own identity, even if it's as thin as a puppet string.","content_length":811,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"The story sees you take on the role of P, a lifelike puppet who wakes up amidst the carnage of a puppet-led invasion of the fictional city of Krat. If you're familiar with Pinocchio, you'll likely recognize character names such as the puppet-maker Geppetto and the talking cricket Gemini. Their names are usually where the similarities end, however--either in relation to the book or any Disney-produced retellings. For one, Gemini isn't an anthropomorphic insect but rather a tiny puppet caged in a lantern on P's belt, acting as both a guide and source of light. Similarly, characters like the Fox, Cat, and Alidoro are reimagined as common criminals and thieves, who don their respective animal masks in order to achieve both anonymity and infamy.","content_length":750,"content_tokens":167,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"It's this unique take on a familiar tale that makes Lies of P such an intriguing proposition, so it's hard not to feel disappointed when the story doesn't kick into gear until close to its final act. For the most part, you're tasked with visiting various locations where you'll need to either rescue someone or defeat a specific enemy before returning to the game's central hub. Without an overarching goal to propel you forward, it feels unfocused and only attains a sense of momentum in its final few hours once the antagonist reveals themself. There's very little to latch onto before this point, outside of a curiosity to see where the narrative could potentially go. It's not a case where the game is holding back and being intentionally opaque either. The story is predominantly told via expositional dumps and there's little sense of mystery as a result. There are interesting moments dotted throughout but they're fleeting, and I don't think it's too harsh to expect more considering the source material.","content_length":1012,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Lies of P also features a morality system that occasionally asks you to make a choice between two options: Tell the truth or lie. Puppets can't lie--it's baked into their programming--but as we all know, Pinocchio is special in this regard. The lies you tell are almost never hurtful or deceitful; you lie to provide comfort rather than confront someone with an uncomfortable truth. One such example lets you ease a dying mother's worry by telling her that her (dead) child is still alive and well, so these choices aren't particularly difficult to make. The decision you choose will mostly depend on which branching path you're eager to see play out. Every time you lie, P's springs react--he becomes more human--so I exclusively lied throughout my playthrough to see what effect this would have on either the story or gameplay. I won't spoil the changes I encountered but overall the mechanic didn't feel well used.","content_length":917,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Neowiz says there are three different endings to unlock, which are affected in some way by how honest you are, but aside from attaining different rewards, it's tough to say how much of the game is impacted by your choices without replaying the whole thing again. Nevertheless, the morality system and the story's shortcomings are lessened somewhat by Lies of P's setting and fantastic sense of place. Each location you visit is sprinkled with interesting lore and visual storytelling, and the game's art design and foreboding atmosphere combine to give the city of Krat an unmistakable personality. The prospect of venturing further into its haunting bowels was all the motivation I needed to push on. Krat's Belle Epoque-era aesthetic is immediately evocative of 19th-century France, right down to the snippets of Bal-musette music that still linger, like echoes of the city's former glory.","content_length":891,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Back before the events of the game, Krat was a city of marvels. The invention of animatronic puppets gave rise to a period of prosperity that's evident throughout, as Neowiz meshes its historical setting with notable steampunk flourishes. After flying too close to the sun, however, the city's affluence has been shattered by what survivors are calling The Puppet Frenzy. This mysterious affliction has turned the once-docile puppets against the city's denizens in violent fashion. Blood-stained bodies now litter the cobblestone streets, while bags of luggage are strewn next to carriages and across train platforms as evidence of those trying to escape the fallen metropolis. Gaslit street lamps and glaring signs for theater productions cast light on the gloomy aftermath, as twitchy, clockwork puppets emerge from the shadows wielding battered stop signs and candelabras as makeshift weapons.","content_length":896,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lies Of P Review - No Strings Attached","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/","post_date":"September 13, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Lies of P oozes atmosphere at nearly every turn, whether you're traversing through Krat's bleeding heart or wading through the ominous forests and scrap yards on its outskirts.

Combat, meanwhile, shares a number of elements in common with Bloodborne. Encounters are fast-paced and emphasize being active and pushing the advantage. You can block attacks, which chips away at both your stamina and health bar, but immediately retaliating lets you regain your lost health. This quickly establishes that it pays to be aggressive, even if you initially adopt a defensive front.

It's worth achieving some level of proficiency, though, because perfect parries also inflict break damage, sending enemies into a staggered state that leaves them open to a deadly critical strike. Timing, rather than positioning, is key to staying alive, yet this approach turns most encounters--but especially boss fights--into lessons in pattern-learning. The enemies you come up against enjoy messing with your rhythm, hesitating for what feels like a second too long on overhand swings, or throwing in an unexpected attack at the end of a combo. This presents a fun challenge but does feel a tad rigid. Nailing a perfectly timed parry is immensely satisfying, though, with each successful block producing an outpouring of incandescent sparks.

And I really mean that; while playing this game, I warped back to an era where I'd turn the TV to channel 4 to get my Nintendo games to appear on the screen before I'd dive into games like Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger. Developer Sabotage Studio's ability to conjure the feelings of the past in a modern game astounds me, but it's obvious a lot of hard work and due diligence has paid off here. Sea Of Stars reflects the best of a bygone era, and it does so with a quality that makes it stand out not only among the giants of the past, but also among those in the present day. Sea Of Stars is a turn-based RPG and a prequel to The Messenger, Sabotage Studio's other retro-tinged romp that focused on 2D Metroidvania elements. The story follows Zale and Valere, two children of destiny who train to become Solstice Warriors, aka mighty fighters who wield the power of the sun and moon. Zale represents the sun, while Valere takes on the powers of the moon. Right away, the game establishes that these two will be inseparable for the entire adventure, but it allows players to choose which of the two party members they want to take the lead, though the choice only affects which character is at the front of the line during the adventure. I like this flexibility, as it gives the player a small bit of agency in an otherwise linear story experience. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The villains are a colorful bunch, ranging from a shadowy quartet named One, Two, Three, and Four who are pulling strings behind the scenes, to a necromancer named Romaya who makes creatures from spare bones and flesh piles during our battle. While the story does take some turns I didn't see coming, for the most part I was able to call out story beats before they happened. I still enjoyed seeing them play out, but the predictability dulled their impact. While individual events may have been predictable, I wasn't fully prepared for some of the heavier themes in Sea Of Stars. This may be a game dressed up in retro attire, but character development in this game ranks highly among the RPGs of today. Serai, one of the companions Zale and Valere meet up with early in the game, is fascinating. Serai's tragic past--the full weight of which doesn't come to fruition until later in the game--informs a lot of her earlier actions, where she lurks in the background and disguises herself in order to track Zale and Valere's progress. They can see through her deception, but they play along in the hopes of gaining her trust. Even in her early appearances, when she seemed shifty, it's apparent she's a good soul. Soon after she joins the group, there's a story beat centered around a coin that, upon completion, made me gasp at how Serai had acted, and it made me happy to add her to the team. The battle system here starts out as standard turn-based RPG fare where each character on-screen--friend or foe--acts individually without interruption on their turn. However, a small countdown will appear next to each enemy, which lets players know how many moves they have before they attack next. This allows players to plan each action accordingly, and I love that strategic element in my turn-based battles. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but this battle system is still a ton of fun every time I'm matched up with an enemy. The turn timer isn't the only new feature of battling; for example, sometimes symbols appear above an enemy on the field along with the countdown. Each symbol represents either a type of attack or an element. If I'm able to attack that enemy in ways that correspond with the symbols before the countdown ends, I can halt that attack altogether. It's a cool mechanic that adds even more strategy to each battle. That said, this particular feature isn't always fair: For example, there were multiple moments where I'd have one turn to remove four symbols, but no one in my party was able to do it. Luckily, every symbol I removed lessened the power of the attack, but I still felt like this mechanic stacked the odds against me unfairly at times. Seeing those symbols create an impossible situation out of nowhere feels like an randomly generated difficulty increase. Sea Of Stars reflects the best of a bygone era, and it does so with a quality that makes it stand out not only among the giants of the past, but also among those in the present dayThis happens more often with the bosses, which range from massive screen-filling creatures to small and powerful beings, and each of them provides a grueling challenge. Some of these boss fights required as much strategy as raw power, as each brought its own wrinkle to the fight. Botanical Horror, for example, had four branches and a central head, and I couldn't damage the head until I brought down the branches. After a few turns, the central head would revive the branches, and I had to deal with them again. Other bosses could easily wipe my team in one or two attacks, which forced me to focus on defense. As such, I never knew what to expect when a boss fight would start, which increased the excitement when I reached one. There's one other added wrinkle to these big fights that I especially appreciate, and it's a simple visual cue. Like in other RPGs of the era, there's no health bar on these bosses, so I don't know precisely how long I have until I achieve victory. However, at a certain point, the boss will begin to look tired and beaten up, with the expressive pixel art to signify that victory is close. Seeing this small change instantly energizes me for the rest of the battle, and the mood immediately becomes intense. That visual signal is a small addition, but it makes each boss battle that much more enjoyable by bringing victory so close that you can taste it. The two Solstice Warriors aren't the only fighters you'll be working with, as throughout the game they'll meet multiple companions who add their own flair to each battle. The aforementioned Serai's poison abilities got me out of a few jams, but my favorite of the bunch is Garl. A childhood friend of Zale and Valere, Garl's ineffable positivity keeps the group going even at the lowest of times. This guy puts up with a lot--he loses an eye as a child while exploring a cave with Zale and Valere, not being a Solstice Warrior means he has to wait 10 years for his friends to finish their isolated training, and he has to sit out one of the more climatic battles simply because he's not a Solstice Warrior-- and yet he continues to encourage, support, and fight alongside his friends. He's also excited about cooking in anadorable way, going so far as to separate from the party to check out a nearby kitchen at one point. Garl is a real one, and more games need characters like him. While the party does grow, battles only allow for the use of three characters at one time. However, unlike in past RPGs where I'd focus on three main characters and leave the rest to the dustbin, Sea Of Stars allows me to keep every hero in the rotation in two key ways. First, in a move hearkening back to Final Fantasy X, I can switch party members on the fly in battle--even if doing so costs me one of my actions. If I'm in a bad spot and my boy Garl is on the sidelines, I can swap him in, let him heal whoever needs it, and pop out. Similarly, if an enemy is weak to a certain element and I forget to swap the right hero in before the fight, I'm not left in the lurch. The second way it does this is one of my favorite parts of the game: The entire party gains experience from battles at the same time. Gone are individual experience bars with sporadic level gains. Here, when I hit the level up screen, everyone's getting a buff. This was a major frustration of mine back in the old days; I distinctly remember getting to the end of Final Fantasy VIII with half of my team maxed out and the other half ignored, and when the final battle randomized my party, things didn't go well for me. Seeing this solution in action made me wish I had the same courtesy back then. Not only that, but I get to choose an extra stat boost for each character during the level up screen, so if I see one of my teammates is low on Magic Defense, and that buff is available to choose, then I can add a little more to that stat. This is a throwback to Super Mario RPG, which offered a similar benefit, and it allows me to keep an eye on my complete team rather than fall into that FFVIII pit again. Each character comes with their own unique abilities, whether it's Garl's healing, the Solstice Warriors' elemental attacks, and so on. Some of them come with small minigame elements to boost their abilities, whether I'm holding a button down to charge an attack or pressing a button with precise timing for multiple hits. I like these ideas, as they provide welcome variety and skill-based elements, but I noticed there are some wonky timing issues going on with a few of the moves. Valere's Moonerang and Serai's Venom Flurry, for instance, felt inconsistent and sometimes wouldn't trigger, even when I hit the button dead on. Gallery That being said, I feel every character stands out amongst the rest of the group. No matter what situation I find myself in, I know that any combination of the three will get me out of it, even if I have to use a turn to swap a new teammate in. It's a cohesive unit of powerful fighters, and thanks to the combo of varied skill sets and full team level-ups, I never felt like I was entering a major fight at a significant disadvantage. The world that hosts these battles features some of the most gorgeous pixel art I've ever seen. From beautiful horizons to even the dark and dreary swamps, the visual style of this game is a delightfully retro look that can fit right in with the best of the SNES era. That said, modern upgrades are definitely noticeable, especially in the animations of background elements. Zale's Sunball ability, for example, creates a giant ball of orange sunlight that reflects off of walls and enemies in real time, as does Valere's blue-tinged Moonerang as it sails across the battlefield. There's some pixel-art sorcery going on here, and all of it has certainly cast a spell on me. Sea Of Stars is a classic SNES-era turn-based RPG that holds up next to the titans of the era. There are bits and pieces of those classics scattered throughout this game, but Sea Of Stars doesn't just rest on the laurels of its predecessors. There are plenty of new little tweaks to the system that kept me on my toes from beginning to end, from unique combat mechanics to a couple of story beats that sent me through a loop--though not as many as I'd hoped. In a crowded year of big-budget AAA releases, Sea Of Stars has an impeccable sense of craft that helps it stand tall alongside them.","length":12914,"tokens":2916,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"At the risk of sounding cliche, Sea Of Stars made me feel like a kid again.

Sea Of Stars reflects the best of a bygone era, and it does so with a quality that makes it stand out not only among the giants of the past, but also among those in the present day. Sea Of Stars is a turn-based RPG and a prequel to The Messenger, Sabotage Studio's other retro-tinged romp that focused on 2D Metroidvania elements.","content_length":806,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"The story follows Zale and Valere, two children of destiny who train to become Solstice Warriors, aka mighty fighters who wield the power of the sun and moon.

I still enjoyed seeing them play out, but the predictability dulled their impact. While individual events may have been predictable, I wasn't fully prepared for some of the heavier themes in Sea Of Stars. This may be a game dressed up in retro attire, but character development in this game ranks highly among the RPGs of today.

They can see through her deception, but they play along in the hopes of gaining her trust. Even in her early appearances, when she seemed shifty, it's apparent she's a good soul. Soon after she joins the group, there's a story beat centered around a coin that, upon completion, made me gasp at how Serai had acted, and it made me happy to add her to the team. The battle system here starts out as standard turn-based RPG fare where each character on-screen--friend or foe--acts individually without interruption on their turn.

It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but this battle system is still a ton of fun every time I'm matched up with an enemy. The turn timer isn't the only new feature of battling; for example, sometimes symbols appear above an enemy on the field along with the countdown. Each symbol represents either a type of attack or an element. If I'm able to attack that enemy in ways that correspond with the symbols before the countdown ends, I can halt that attack altogether. It's a cool mechanic that adds even more strategy to each battle. That said, this particular feature isn't always fair: For example, there were multiple moments where I'd have one turn to remove four symbols, but no one in my party was able to do it.","content_length":825,"content_tokens":172,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"Luckily, every symbol I removed lessened the power of the attack, but I still felt like this mechanic stacked the odds against me unfairly at times.

Some of these boss fights required as much strategy as raw power, as each brought its own wrinkle to the fight. Botanical Horror, for example, had four branches and a central head, and I couldn't damage the head until I brought down the branches.

As such, I never knew what to expect when a boss fight would start, which increased the excitement when I reached one. There's one other added wrinkle to these big fights that I especially appreciate, and it's a simple visual cue. Like in other RPGs of the era, there's no health bar on these bosses, so I don't know precisely how long I have until I achieve victory. However, at a certain point, the boss will begin to look tired and beaten up, with the expressive pixel art to signify that victory is close. Seeing this small change instantly energizes me for the rest of the battle, and the mood immediately becomes intense. That visual signal is a small addition, but it makes each boss battle that much more enjoyable by bringing victory so close that you can taste it.","content_length":873,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"The two Solstice Warriors aren't the only fighters you'll be working with, as throughout the game they'll meet multiple companions who add their own flair to each battle.

A childhood friend of Zale and Valere, Garl's ineffable positivity keeps the group going even at the lowest of times. This guy puts up with a lot--he loses an eye as a child while exploring a cave with Zale and Valere, not being a Solstice Warrior means he has to wait 10 years for his friends to finish their isolated training, and he has to sit out one of the more climatic battles simply because he's not a Solstice Warrior-- and yet he continues to encourage, support, and fight alongside his friends.","content_length":784,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"He's also excited about cooking in anadorable way, going so far as to separate from the party to check out a nearby kitchen at one point.

However, unlike in past RPGs where I'd focus on three main characters and leave the rest to the dustbin, Sea Of Stars allows me to keep every hero in the rotation in two key ways. First, in a move hearkening back to Final Fantasy X, I can switch party members on the fly in battle--even if doing so costs me one of my actions. If I'm in a bad spot and my boy Garl is on the sidelines, I can swap him in, let him heal whoever needs it, and pop out.","content_length":737,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"Similarly, if an enemy is weak to a certain element and I forget to swap the right hero in before the fight, I'm not left in the lurch. The second way it does this is one of my favorite parts of the game: The entire party gains experience from battles at the same time. Gone are individual experience bars with sporadic level gains. Here, when I hit the level up screen, everyone's getting a buff. This was a major frustration of mine back in the old days; I distinctly remember getting to the end of Final Fantasy VIII with half of my team maxed out and the other half ignored, and when the final battle randomized my party, things didn't go well for me.

This is a throwback to Super Mario RPG, which offered a similar benefit, and it allows me to keep an eye on my complete team rather than fall into that FFVIII pit again. Each character comes with their own unique abilities, whether it's Garl's healing, the Solstice Warriors' elemental attacks, and so on. Some of them come with small minigame elements to boost their abilities, whether I'm holding a button down to charge an attack or pressing a button with precise timing for multiple hits. I like these ideas, as they provide welcome variety and skill-based elements, but I noticed there are some wonky timing issues going on with a few of the moves.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Sea Of Stars Review - Playing With Power","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-stars-review-playing-with-power/1900-6418113/","post_date":"September 8, 2023 at 12:55PM PDT","content":"Valere's Moonerang and Serai's Venom Flurry, for instance, felt inconsistent and sometimes wouldn't trigger, even when I hit the button dead on.

It's a cohesive unit of powerful fighters, and thanks to the combo of varied skill sets and full team level-ups, I never felt like I was entering a major fight at a significant disadvantage. The world that hosts these battles features some of the most gorgeous pixel art I've ever seen.

Zale's Sunball ability, for example, creates a giant ball of orange sunlight that reflects off of walls and enemies in real time, as does Valere's blue-tinged Moonerang as it sails across the battlefield. There's some pixel-art sorcery going on here, and all of it has certainly cast a spell on me. Sea Of Stars is a classic SNES-era turn-based RPG that holds up next to the titans of the era. There are bits and pieces of those classics scattered throughout this game, but Sea Of Stars doesn't just rest on the laurels of its predecessors. There are plenty of new little tweaks to the system that kept me on my toes from beginning to end, from unique combat mechanics to a couple of story beats that sent me through a loop--though not as many as I'd hoped. In a crowded year of big-budget AAA releases, Sea Of Stars has an impeccable sense of craft that helps it stand tall alongside them.","content_length":996,"content_tokens":218,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Starfield Review - To Infinity, But Not Beyond","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/","date":"August 31, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"It's hard to ponder the infinite possibilities of space and not get romantic about it. Our imagination of the cosmos has taken many artistic forms, and the hard science behind the greatest discoveries on the final frontier has been just as enthralling. It's this sense of wonder that makes the prospect of Starfield so intriguing--even more so than if it were just Bethesda Game Studios' next major RPG. However, it's best to cast aside that love and fascination with space because, at its core, Starfield follows a very familiar formula without meaningfully engaging with its setting or the gameplay systems therein. Starfield is undoubtedly impressive in scale, from the sheer number of star systems and planets you can explore to the multitude of gameplay mechanics that tie the experience together. But once you start to see how all these big ideas are interconnected from a narrative perspective and technical standpoint, the illusion of a grand cosmic voyage shatters and the veneer starts to wear thin. And so, somewhere along my 55 or so hours spent playing Starfield, I dropped the notion of finding that wondrous space adventure and accepted Starfield for what it is: a shooter-focused RPG in the traditional Bethesda framework that has its wild and fun moments but one that's ultimately a mile wide and an inch deep. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Despite romanticizing the idea of taking to the stars to explore the great unknown, these narrative ambitions fall into shallow stories that undersell the spacefaring premise. You start as a lowly miner extracting resources for a faceless corporation and within minutes, come in contact with an \"Artifact\" that activates mysterious visions of something bigger out in the galaxy--a sort of leaving-the-vault moment like in Fallout. You're then shuffled into the ranks of a small organization called Constellation, whose sole purpose is to chase these Artifacts and uncover their purpose. With the handful of characters who make up the group, Starfield tries to instill personality into its story, but consistently weak writing and generic dialogue means these characters--who do have a few interesting moments along the way--largely fall flat. It's especially tough to buy into the Artifact-collecting scenario when the game's story extolls the virtues of science, yet undermines them by haphazardly throwing around scientific concepts in dialogue and then resorting to inexplicable supernatural forces that everyone in-game seems to just accept at face value. There's very little weight or impact given to what characters often describe as great discoveries that could change the course of history, and it's missing an earnest examination on the nature of humanity's place in space, even when it tries to be self-reflective. I was never asking Starfield to lecture me on quantum physics, but I hoped for a story that wants to pay reverence to the scientific philosophies that make the genre intriguing to give those concepts their necessary respect. The wild goose chase that is the main quest lacks strong motivations from a narrative perspective, and the mission structure mostly relies on a predictable formula. You're often shooting your way through mining facilities to dig up Artifacts your colleagues happened to locate halfway across the galaxy, which involves taking down space pirates because you need someone to shoot. Or you're fast-traveling to faraway star systems to fetch clues on the next objective, follow laughably nonsensical riddles, or have conversations that could've been an email. There are occasional breaks in this process that lead to notable moments, such as having to navigate the grimey underbelly of the cyberpunk-inspired city of Neon, where all the dystopian archetypes thrive. Engaging in tense conversations offer some variance in the moment-to-moment beats but the outcomes are largely the same, like when I had to resolve a bank robbery on a remote planet that resembled the American Old West, or cut a deal with a space pirate for an important item I needed--you'd be surprised how far a simple Persuasion check can get you, yet how little the game cared if it went one way or another. If the situation devolved into a shootout, the people around town would barely bat an eye or give a tangible response to the fact that I resorted to violence. These kinds of moments highlight the illusion of choice, where supposed moral quandaries boil down to vague differences in philosophy, and this extends across the story and through the final encounters with Starfield's main antagonists. Towards the end, the main quest legitimately started to shine by setting aside its RPG-light storytelling and embracing being a full-on shooter. One sequence borrows inspiration from Titanfall 2's Effect and Cause mission, and a late-game mission tested the limits of my combat prowess with satisfying challenge. And despite the underwhelming revelations leading up to the conclusion, Starfield does have a moment of brilliance in how it lets you end your journey, contextualizing New Game+ in one of the most interesting ways I've seen while offering a few noteworthy incentives for a second run. As is tradition with Bethesda games, however, the golden path questline is not exactly the main course, and it's in the side quests where Starfield is at its best. Here, you set aside the wonders of the great unknown and instead dive into the problems of various factions and the people who've settled in the few cities and towns scattered across the galaxy. One such example is the Crimson Fleet faction questline, where the de facto galactic government coerces you into going undercover inside space's biggest criminal ring--and this chain of quests is one of the finest in a Bethesda RPG. It's not so much the ethical dilemmas or tension you feel when bouncing between the two factions, but the fact you find yourself in the middle of some wild situations like corporate disputes, intense shootouts, blackmailing characters, and infiltrating high-security facilities. Compelling subplots emerge in the process that also tie back to the quest at hand, and you're hit with some exceptional setpieces that incorporate multiple facets of Starfield's gameplay systems at a steady pace. I even found myself conflicted when making final decisions since certain side characters began to grow on me. Once the dust settled, I moved on with trekking the galaxy, constantly searching for the same high. Not every optional questline matches that scope and depth, but there are certainly rare flashes of similar quality. Getting caught up in megacorp Ryujin Industries' messy business by starting as a rank-and-file employee then meddling in its affairs from the inside was worth seeing through for the corporate drama. Playing space deputy for the Freestar Collective, on the other hand, wasn't as intriguing per se. It turned out to be predictable on the whole, but it took me to new locations, featured some fun firefights, and offered valuable rewards. Although a bit superficial, helping a ship full of people who never made human contact after leaving Earth hundreds of years ago brought me to a resort-style planet to deal with a greedy CEO, and ultimately gave me the chance to find those in need a new home. Side content comes in varying degrees of quality, but these are the kinds of rabbit holes you want to fall down; they are what make Starfield worth unraveling, even if the process often feels like a checklist of objectives to blaze through. And at times, they culminate in something almost meaningful. At the same time, the setting starts to seem superficial as it's less about life on the cosmic frontier and more about petty human problems that are just by-the-book extensions of what we deal with on Earth. While they don't give the impression of having major impacts on the galaxy's fate, or explore topics of technology and corporate exploitation impacting human life with much depth, side content is dealt out in droves, and the potential of finding something special propelled me to keep perusing the galaxy in hopes of discovering a worthwhile thread.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186384-unknown-2023_08_27-16_37_12. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4186384-unknown-2023_08_27-16_37_12. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186384-unknown-2023_08_27-16_37_12. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4186384-unknown-2023_08_27-16_37_12. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Through these various questlines--main story and side content alike--the limitations of Starfield's RPG elements came to light. Dialogue options evoke slightly different responses or tease more information, but rarely influence the overarching path. Once you see the machinations, you can gauge what you can get away with and realize quests stay on a set track. You may get the opportunity to use the arbitrary Persuasion check, which breaks off as a minigame awkwardly detached from the actual conversation at hand, or bribe your way past objectives, but those exist as shortcuts to the same end result. However, there's still a sense of building your character and progression since you can pick permanent traits at the start and earn skill points as you level up. The skill tree streamlines the perks, stats, and traits of previous Bethesda RPGs which makes sense because Starfield isn't really concerned with giving you multiple avenues to solve problems or complete objectives. There aren't really \"builds,\" rather game mechanics you'll want to prioritize like damage for specific weapon-types, lockpicking, persuasion success rate, or whatever you deem important engaging with. Starfield picks up some of that slack when it becomes a shooter thanks to satisfying gunplay and a roster of varied weapons to tinker with. While you shouldn't expect the feel of, say, Destiny 2, the shooting in Starfield is by far the best Bethesda has offered. Especially when I was zipping around with my jetpack in a big firefight, melting robots with a tricked-out laser rifle before switching to a punchy auto-shotgun to thin out space pirates or blast away intimidating creatures, it was hard to deny Starfield's chops as a shooter. When combat clicks and sustains the intensity in high-level shootouts, it mitigates the sting of the shallow RPG systems in place.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186385-unknown-2023_08_23-11_11_13. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4186385-unknown-2023_08_23-11_11_13. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186385-unknown-2023_08_23-11_11_13. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4186385-unknown-2023_08_23-11_11_13. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The spacefaring fantasy wouldn't be complete without your own ship to pilot in dogfights. Ship combat can be frustrating at times, and having to manually allocate a pool of resources to specific functions of your ship on the fly--like engine speed, weapon power, and shield potency--takes some getting used to. But, as I got more involved in earning new ships, upgrading my piloting skills, and buying better parts, I became more satisfied with engaging in ship combat, especially against imposing enemy fleets who I also had to outmaneuver to take down. They're straightforward encounters, but some quests will force you into these scenarios with some dramatic narrative context, which helps it feel like less of an afterthought. While I do appreciate having a spaceship as a means to break up the pace and add variety with combat, piloting one also highlights the segmented nature of how you actually navigate Starfield's worlds. Presumably for convenience's sake, trekking across the galaxy is relegated to strings of fast travel points. You pull up your starmap, chart the course, jump to a planet's low orbit, then select largely predetermined landing points on the surface. There's a lack of seamlessness since each step in the process is broken into multiple steps where you're mostly pulling up menus, watching short scene transitions, and sitting through loading screens. It's worth noting that you don't actually fly to planets in real-time, and flying in space is sort of an instanced bubble with nearby planets in the background. All this creates the feeling that Starfield's universe is rather small and, very quickly, I'd treat planets as a collection of fast-travel points, disjointed stand-ins for individual towns or cities. Impressively massive metropolises like New Atlantis or dense and interesting cities like Neon are peppered throughout the journey, but unlike in the Elder Scrolls or Fallout games, there isn't a build-up to discovering them. This is due in part to the absence of a larger overworld that can be used to pique interest and stoke curiosity, leading players to have that moment of unveiling new locations. Instead, it's the menus that funnel players directly into these locations, eliminating the sense of awe and wonder that comes from stumbling upon them. And even finding your way around these places is a pain with the near-complete absence of a local map system--I became familiar enough with the pathways to find key locations in frequently visited places, but it's a major oversight that in a space-traveling future, we can't get a halfway decent map of the most populated settlements.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186386-contentscreenshot2023.08.27-20.47.35.71. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4186386-contentscreenshot2023.08.27-20.47.35.71. png 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186386-contentscreenshot2023.08.27-20.47.35.71. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4186386-contentscreenshot2023.08.27-20.47.35.71. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Though very limited from a gameplay perspective, space exploration is still novel in Starfield, harkening back to the hours I spent in Mass Effect's galaxy maps out of sheer curiosity. Pulling up the starmap to see a hundred-something planets is stunning, and I still love being overwhelmed by the view of a new planet from my ship in low orbit and reading its data as if it's a real place. However, the sense of discovery is dulled when I'm often landing on barren planets, slogging my way across them on foot only to find the same mining facility or research laboratory I found halfway across the galaxy on another planet. One consolation is being able to build your own outposts on habitable planets, which is an endeavor for those who want to get into setting up mining operations for resource collecting and using the research mechanics to unlock new items. Starfield borrows from Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 in this regard, and the systems and inventory management are as cumbersome as ever. But from the few hours I spent delving into building my own outpost on a remote planet in the far reaches of space, I saw the value of establishing an ecosystem even if it's only for the sake of creating intricate settlements for myself and crewmates I've recruited to help with the operation. There are a ton of interconnected systems that make up Starfield's overall gameplay experience, so in a way, it's surprising to see how it comes together with relative polish. Bethesda RPGs have a reputation for being buggy--and don't get me wrong, Starfield has its fair share of bugs--but I've mostly encountered rather inoffensive glitches like floating eyeballs or characters clipping through walls or getting stuck in place, which were fixed by reloading or rebooting the game. Across my 55-plus hours, I jumped between a high-end PC, a minimum-spec laptop, and both Xbox Series X and S. Starfield is a demanding game and you'll get some frame drops in densely populated areas or in the heat of battle where particle effects fill up the screen, yet the game always managed to stay playable on reasonable graphics settings. The 30fps cap on consoles is a bit disappointing, but the most important part is that it held a consistent frame rate throughout.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186388-contentscreenshot2023.08.23-17.36.52.41. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4186388-contentscreenshot2023.08.23-17.36.52.41. png 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4186388-contentscreenshot2023.08.23-17.36.52.41. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4186388-contentscreenshot2023.08.23-17.36.52.41. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Accounting for all its ups and downs, the main thing I wrestle with is that Starfield is missing an overall sense of purpose. My favorite RPGs have their fair share of shortcomings and limitations, but the best ones always leave a lasting impact that comes through having a clear purpose. Even my favorite Bethesda RPGs do this well. Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim have intricate magic systems, cultures to familiarize yourself with, and rewards for exploration in whichever direction you wander in. Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas drops you in a barren desert wasteland as a nobody, yet is so full of personality, humor, and sobering examinations of the human condition in the wake of a societal collapse. I can't help but feel Starfield banked on the intrigue of space exploration and the vastness of the cosmos, and forgot to create an identity beyond that. Despite the nigh-limitless possibilities the final frontier offers, Starfield's version of humanity remains largely homogeneous--300 or so years into the future across the galaxy, and the game's imagination rarely extends beyond the sci-fi archetypes we've seen many a time. It doesn't have much to say about humanity leaving Earth behind and doesn't really reckon with the realities that dictate the world--our world--that inspires its very premise. In the periphery, you can learn about how life is sustainable across the galaxy or tease out lore on how governments and religions evolved, but Starfield struggles to integrate that into its core ethos. I didn't come in expecting something poetic like the Carl Sagan books I read growing up, awe-inspiring like The Outer Wilds, or as intricate as the sci-fi lore built over the course of the Mass Effect trilogy. But I did want something more than the pared-down Bethesda template transposed over a space setting. Starfield has its moments, for sure. Its satisfying gunplay makes combat exciting, especially when it's integrated into setpieces within its better, more captivating questlines. And although limited in its conception of space exploration, there's a novelty in poking around the galaxy to see star systems up close and personal, and occasionally finding side content worth chasing. However, it struggles to deliver a cohesive and memorable RPG experience amid the seemingly boundless sea of stars. For all its reverence for scientific philosophy, its stories and characters paint a rather tame and sterile vision for what our spacefaring future could look like. When you strip Starfield down to its essentials, it relies on a tried-and-true, but well-tread formula while missing some of the depth of the games that came before it. Starfield is a game more concerned with quantity than quality, and leaves the experience at the surface level.","length":21775,"tokens":4951,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Starfield Review - To Infinity, But Not Beyond","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/","post_date":"August 31, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"It's hard to ponder the infinite possibilities of space and not get romantic about it. Our imagination of the cosmos has taken many artistic forms, and the hard science behind the greatest discoveries on the final frontier has been just as enthralling. It's this sense of wonder that makes the prospect of Starfield so intriguing--even more so than if it were just Bethesda Game Studios' next major RPG. However, it's best to cast aside that love and fascination with space because, at its core, Starfield follows a very familiar formula without meaningfully engaging with its setting or the gameplay systems therein. Starfield is undoubtedly impressive in scale, from the sheer number of star systems and planets you can explore to the multitude of gameplay mechanics that tie the experience together. But once you start to see how all these big ideas are interconnected from a narrative perspective and technical standpoint, the illusion of a grand cosmic voyage shatters and the veneer starts to wear thin. And so, somewhere along my 55 or so hours spent playing Starfield, I dropped the notion of finding that wondrous space adventure and accepted Starfield for what it is: a shooter-focused RPG in the traditional Bethesda framework that has its wild and fun moments but one that's ultimately a mile wide and an inch deep.","content_length":1326,"content_tokens":257,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Starfield Review - To Infinity, But Not Beyond","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/","post_date":"August 31, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

You're then shuffled into the ranks of a small organization called Constellation, whose sole purpose is to chase these Artifacts and uncover their purpose.

I was never asking Starfield to lecture me on quantum physics, but I hoped for a story that wants to pay reverence to the scientific philosophies that make the genre intriguing to give those concepts their necessary respect.

If the situation devolved into a shootout, the people around town would barely bat an eye or give a tangible response to the fact that I resorted to violence. These kinds of moments highlight the illusion of choice, where supposed moral quandaries boil down to vague differences in philosophy, and this extends across the story and through the final encounters with Starfield's main antagonists.

While I do appreciate having a spaceship as a means to break up the pace and add variety with combat, piloting one also highlights the segmented nature of how you actually navigate Starfield's worlds. Presumably for convenience's sake, trekking across the galaxy is relegated to strings of fast travel points. You pull up your starmap, chart the course, jump to a planet's low orbit, then select largely predetermined landing points on the surface. There's a lack of seamlessness since each step in the process is broken into multiple steps where you're mostly pulling up menus, watching short scene transitions, and sitting through loading screens. It's worth noting that you don't actually fly to planets in real-time, and flying in space is sort of an instanced bubble with nearby planets in the background.","content_length":986,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Starfield Review - To Infinity, But Not Beyond","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/","post_date":"August 31, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"All this creates the feeling that Starfield's universe is rather small and, very quickly, I'd treat planets as a collection of fast-travel points, disjointed stand-ins for individual towns or cities.

This is due in part to the absence of a larger overworld that can be used to pique interest and stoke curiosity, leading players to have that moment of unveiling new locations.

I can't help but feel Starfield banked on the intrigue of space exploration and the vastness of the cosmos, and forgot to create an identity beyond that. Despite the nigh-limitless possibilities the final frontier offers, Starfield's version of humanity remains largely homogeneous--300 or so years into the future across the galaxy, and the game's imagination rarely extends beyond the sci-fi archetypes we've seen many a time.

But I did want something more than the pared-down Bethesda template transposed over a space setting. Starfield has its moments, for sure. Its satisfying gunplay makes combat exciting, especially when it's integrated into setpieces within its better, more captivating questlines. And although limited in its conception of space exploration, there's a novelty in poking around the galaxy to see star systems up close and personal, and occasionally finding side content worth chasing. However, it struggles to deliver a cohesive and memorable RPG experience amid the seemingly boundless sea of stars. For all its reverence for scientific philosophy, its stories and characters paint a rather tame and sterile vision for what our spacefaring future could look like. When you strip Starfield down to its essentials, it relies on a tried-and-true, but well-tread formula while missing some of the depth of the games that came before it. Starfield is a game more concerned with quantity than quality, and leaves the experience at the surface level.","content_length":1453,"content_tokens":289,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"Rubicon 3, the setting for Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, is a far cry from the likes of Lordran and The Lands Between, immediately establishing a striking sci-fi aesthetic that's unlike anything From Software has created in the past decade.

This mysterious substance is immensely valuable, causing a number of extraplanetary corporations to descend upon the planet in an all-out war to harness it. You enter the fray as an independent mercenary employed by the enigmatic Handler Walter, who orders you to complete jobs on behalf of whichever faction is willing to pay. Referred to only as 621 or your callsign, Raven, the story in Armored Core VI has an oddly impersonal feel. Much of the narrative is delivered through audio on a static screen, with nary a human face in sight. Being a silent protagonist also makes it difficult to escape the feeling that you're a puppet for those pulling the strings. This is seemingly intentional, although the story never quite delves deep enough into this feeling of detachment to say anything meaningful. Most of the characters are fairly cliched, even if the voice acting is generally entertaining, and while there are interesting aspects to the lore, the story is ultimately disappointing without ever being particularly bad. The narrative does afford you a degree of agency at times, as you're occasionally asked to choose between two missions for two different factions, thus creating a branching path that affects both future missions and the game's ending. This adds replayability to future playthroughs, although it's in new game plus where this feature comes into its own. Armored Core VI doesn't quite venture down the Nier: Automata route, but it opts for a similar vibe. New missions appear during new game plus, while familiar quests are altered, adding extra choices that can change how they play out. These surprises make the campaign worth playing again if you weren't already itching to dive back in. Once you've settled into the cockpit of a titular Armored Core, the first thing that jumps out is how easy Armored Core VI is to pick up and play. Your mech can be equipped with up to four weapons at once, each one assigned to a different shoulder button. You can jump, perform a quick dodge both on the ground and in the air, and engage an assault boost that resembles a sprint--propelling you forward with the type of g-force that presumably makes it look like you've aged about 30 years. There's a familiarity to the controls that's comparable to other third-person shooters, but that's where most comparisons end. Much like Armored Core IV, there's a focus on speed and maneuverability, to the point where even the heaviest mechs are able to glide across the battlefield with relative ease. Movement feels fluid and responsive, and although you can't stay suspended in the air indefinitely, you can remain airborne for a good while before needing to land. Combine this with the ability to fire four weapons concurrently, and you've got the makings of an exhilarating combat style that rarely eases off. Game director Masaru Yamamura previously served as the primary combat designer on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, so this approach doesn't come as much of a surprise. Sekiro's brazen DNA is evident in Armored Core VI's combat ethos. There's an emphasis on adopting an aggressive combat style that's derived from your mech's mobility and firepower, but also the game's stagger mechanic. Each successful attack on an enemy combatant applies strain to their Attitude Control System (ACS). When this gauge fills up, it causes them to stagger and freeze in place, giving you a brief window with which to inflict more damage than your shots normally would. If you let up at any point, the strain on their ACS gradually declines, so you're incentivized to push the action and remain on the front foot. This creates a precarious balancing act since your mech has its own ACS that abides by the same ruleset. In some instances, it might be wise to disengage and find cover until your own strain declines, or opt to continue pushing the pace in the hopes of staggering your opponent first. Most of the rank-and-file enemy types you encounter are literal cannon fodder and explode after one or two hits, so the stagger mechanic only comes into play against particularly menacing foes. Armored Core VI maintains the mission structure of previous games in the series, with each chapter containing a mixture of story and side quests within self-contained levels. These missions are wonderfully varied, whether you're fighting mechs on a frozen lake or climbing up the side of a weaponized mining ship that dwarfs your Armored Core with its monumental scale.[Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is] a game for the die-hards but also represents the most approachable game in the series thus far--one that sees From Software return to its roots in triumphant fashion. The bulk of the fighting takes place against regular enemies, while mini-bosses regularly appear and boss fights punctuate certain missions by bumping up the difficulty with a memorable clash. Much of the game acts as a power fantasy that sees you lay waste to dozens of enemies without breaking a sweat before a boss shows up and knocks you down a peg or two. These battles present a challenge consistent with From Software's previous work, but these erratic difficulty spikes create an odd juxtaposition with the rest of the game, even if it makes sense within the game's lore--since the Armored Cores are much more advanced than the standard, mass-produced mechs populating the battlefield. It never feels like the game adequately prepares you for facing a genuine threat, which can make the opening hours frustrating at times when you suddenly hit a boss-shaped roadblock. Fortunately, Armored Core VI is still more approachable than the series has been in the past. For one, there are numerous training missions to partake in that explain everything from the basic controls and combat fundamentals to the differences between a tetrapod AC and a reverse-jointed AC. Crucially, it does this by giving you the opportunity to try out various loadouts and get a feel for how each one functions and differentiates itself from the others. Assembling your Armored Core is as crucial to success as mastering the game's combat mechanics. Rather than leveling up, progression is tied to acquiring new parts and using them to create a distinct mech that's wholly your own. From Software wisely holds off on immediately paralyzing you with too much choice as new parts are unlocked gradually, and you can sell parts back for the same price you bought them, encouraging you to frequently experiment and try new builds. Eventually, your options increase tenfold and you can create Armored Cores that feel significantly different from one another. You might opt for dual-wielding machine guns or mini-guns, equip a plasma rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other, or forgo guns completely in favor of a pulse shield and laser sword combo. When it comes to body parts, there are fluctuations in weight and armor between the multitude of heads, arms, torsos, and legs you can equip. Boosters have tangible effects on dodge speed and leap ability, while chipsets alter how effective your missile lock-on is at different ranges. You can't just slap anything together and hope it works either. Each loadout must adhere to weight and energy restrictions so you can't, say, rock up with a lightweight mech equipped with four bulky cannons. This establishes a balance and forces you to consider the pros and cons of each build, and it's here where the marriage between assembly and combat really shines. The first time you fight a boss is typically a learning experience. I defeated a couple of bosses on the first attempt, but most of the time I had to re-assess and experiment with different builds to counteract their unique properties. The Juggernaut, for instance, is one of the game's early bosses--a massive tank that's impervious to damage from the front thanks to its armor plating. Circling around to attack it from the back and sides is the only way to inflict damage, but it's surprisingly nimble for its size, frequently deploying its huge thrusters to outmaneuver you. It's entirely possible to beat the Juggernaut by constantly positioning yourself behind its impenetrable armor, but I expedited the process by also equipping a vertical rocket launcher. Rather than firing a barrage of missiles in a straight line, this variant launches each armament upwards so they would come hurtling out of the sky and impact behind the Juggernaut's defenses. Beating a boss is incredibly satisfying on its own, but especially after you've found a way to adapt and alter your build to do so. Gallery You can't summon another player to help you take down a troublesome boss like many of the Souls games either, yet this doesn't prevent Armored Core VI from maintaining a semblance of community. Anyone can save a loadout and then share it for other players to equip. That said, it's not the most convenient system to use since you can't simply view a list of every shared loadout. Instead, you need a person's in-game ID in order to download their creations. I can't imagine it will be difficult to find those willing to share their boss-specific builds, though. The only other online component of Armored Core VI is versus matches where you can battle other players in either 1v1 or 3v3 matches. The netcode holds up and these bouts are hectic but fun in short bursts. Without any game modes beyond a simple deathmatch, however, they're unlikely to achieve much longevity. Armored Core VI represents a new beginning for the long-running series. It still remains true to From Software's original vision, but the whole experience has been refined to welcome an audience that cut its teeth on the studio's most recent work. Its story is a letdown and there may be some early growing pains due to its lopsided approach, but these shortcomings quickly scurry to the back of your mind once you start weaving your fully customized mech between incoming attacks while unleashing a salvo of rocket fire, sword swipes, and plasma rounds.","length":13425,"tokens":2852,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"Rubicon 3, the setting for Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, is a far cry from the likes of Lordran and The Lands Between, immediately establishing a striking sci-fi aesthetic that's unlike anything From Software has created in the past decade.

You enter the fray as an independent mercenary employed by the enigmatic Handler Walter, who orders you to complete jobs on behalf of whichever faction is willing to pay. Referred to only as 621 or your callsign, Raven, the story in Armored Core VI has an oddly impersonal feel. Much of the narrative is delivered through audio on a static screen, with nary a human face in sight. Being a silent protagonist also makes it difficult to escape the feeling that you're a puppet for those pulling the strings. This is seemingly intentional, although the story never quite delves deep enough into this feeling of detachment to say anything meaningful. Most of the characters are fairly cliched, even if the voice acting is generally entertaining, and while there are interesting aspects to the lore, the story is ultimately disappointing without ever being particularly bad.","content_length":1026,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"The narrative does afford you a degree of agency at times, as you're occasionally asked to choose between two missions for two different factions, thus creating a branching path that affects both future missions and the game's ending. This adds replayability to future playthroughs, although it's in new game plus where this feature comes into its own. Armored Core VI doesn't quite venture down the Nier: Automata route, but it opts for a similar vibe. New missions appear during new game plus, while familiar quests are altered, adding extra choices that can change how they play out. These surprises make the campaign worth playing again if you weren't already itching to dive back in. Once you've settled into the cockpit of a titular Armored Core, the first thing that jumps out is how easy Armored Core VI is to pick up and play.

There's a familiarity to the controls that's comparable to other third-person shooters, but that's where most comparisons end. Much like Armored Core IV, there's a focus on speed and maneuverability, to the point where even the heaviest mechs are able to glide across the battlefield with relative ease. Movement feels fluid and responsive, and although you can't stay suspended in the air indefinitely, you can remain airborne for a good while before needing to land. Combine this with the ability to fire four weapons concurrently, and you've got the makings of an exhilarating combat style that rarely eases off.","content_length":850,"content_tokens":173,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"Game director Masaru Yamamura previously served as the primary combat designer on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, so this approach doesn't come as much of a surprise. Sekiro's brazen DNA is evident in Armored Core VI's combat ethos. There's an emphasis on adopting an aggressive combat style that's derived from your mech's mobility and firepower, but also the game's stagger mechanic. Each successful attack on an enemy combatant applies strain to their Attitude Control System (ACS) When this gauge fills up, it causes them to stagger and freeze in place, giving you a brief window with which to inflict more damage than your shots normally would. If you let up at any point, the strain on their ACS gradually declines, so you're incentivized to push the action and remain on the front foot. This creates a precarious balancing act since your mech has its own ACS that abides by the same ruleset.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"In some instances, it might be wise to disengage and find cover until your own strain declines, or opt to continue pushing the pace in the hopes of staggering your opponent first. Most of the rank-and-file enemy types you encounter are literal cannon fodder and explode after one or two hits, so the stagger mechanic only comes into play against particularly menacing foes. Armored Core VI maintains the mission structure of previous games in the series, with each chapter containing a mixture of story and side quests within self-contained levels. These missions are wonderfully varied, whether you're fighting mechs on a frozen lake or climbing up the side of a weaponized mining ship that dwarfs your Armored Core with its monumental scale.[Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is] a game for the die-hards but also represents the most approachable game in the series thus far--one that sees From Software return to its roots in triumphant fashion.","content_length":948,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"The bulk of the fighting takes place against regular enemies, while mini-bosses regularly appear and boss fights punctuate certain missions by bumping up the difficulty with a memorable clash. Much of the game acts as a power fantasy that sees you lay waste to dozens of enemies without breaking a sweat before a boss shows up and knocks you down a peg or two. These battles present a challenge consistent with From Software's previous work, but these erratic difficulty spikes create an odd juxtaposition with the rest of the game, even if it makes sense within the game's lore--since the Armored Cores are much more advanced than the standard, mass-produced mechs populating the battlefield. It never feels like the game adequately prepares you for facing a genuine threat, which can make the opening hours frustrating at times when you suddenly hit a boss-shaped roadblock. Fortunately, Armored Core VI is still more approachable than the series has been in the past.","content_length":970,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"For one, there are numerous training missions to partake in that explain everything from the basic controls and combat fundamentals to the differences between a tetrapod AC and a reverse-jointed AC. Crucially, it does this by giving you the opportunity to try out various loadouts and get a feel for how each one functions and differentiates itself from the others. Assembling your Armored Core is as crucial to success as mastering the game's combat mechanics. Rather than leveling up, progression is tied to acquiring new parts and using them to create a distinct mech that's wholly your own. From Software wisely holds off on immediately paralyzing you with too much choice as new parts are unlocked gradually, and you can sell parts back for the same price you bought them, encouraging you to frequently experiment and try new builds. Eventually, your options increase tenfold and you can create Armored Cores that feel significantly different from one another.","content_length":965,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"You might opt for dual-wielding machine guns or mini-guns, equip a plasma rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other, or forgo guns completely in favor of a pulse shield and laser sword combo. When it comes to body parts, there are fluctuations in weight and armor between the multitude of heads, arms, torsos, and legs you can equip. Boosters have tangible effects on dodge speed and leap ability, while chipsets alter how effective your missile lock-on is at different ranges. You can't just slap anything together and hope it works either. Each loadout must adhere to weight and energy restrictions so you can't, say, rock up with a lightweight mech equipped with four bulky cannons. This establishes a balance and forces you to consider the pros and cons of each build, and it's here where the marriage between assembly and combat really shines. The first time you fight a boss is typically a learning experience.","content_length":919,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"I defeated a couple of bosses on the first attempt, but most of the time I had to re-assess and experiment with different builds to counteract their unique properties. The Juggernaut, for instance, is one of the game's early bosses--a massive tank that's impervious to damage from the front thanks to its armor plating. Circling around to attack it from the back and sides is the only way to inflict damage, but it's surprisingly nimble for its size, frequently deploying its huge thrusters to outmaneuver you. It's entirely possible to beat the Juggernaut by constantly positioning yourself behind its impenetrable armor, but I expedited the process by also equipping a vertical rocket launcher. Rather than firing a barrage of missiles in a straight line, this variant launches each armament upwards so they would come hurtling out of the sky and impact behind the Juggernaut's defenses.","content_length":889,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/","post_date":"August 30, 2023 at 8:17AM PDT","content":"Beating a boss is incredibly satisfying on its own, but especially after you've found a way to adapt and alter your build to do so. Gallery You can't summon another player to help you take down a troublesome boss like many of the Souls games either, yet this doesn't prevent Armored Core VI from maintaining a semblance of community. Anyone can save a loadout and then share it for other players to equip. That said, it's not the most convenient system to use since you can't simply view a list of every shared loadout. Instead, you need a person's in-game ID in order to download their creations. I can't imagine it will be difficult to find those willing to share their boss-specific builds, though. The only other online component of Armored Core VI is versus matches where you can battle other players in either 1v1 or 3v3 matches.

Armored Core VI represents a new beginning for the long-running series. It still remains true to From Software's original vision, but the whole experience has been refined to welcome an audience that cut its teeth on the studio's most recent work. Its story is a letdown and there may be some early growing pains due to its lopsided approach, but these shortcomings quickly scurry to the back of your mind once you start weaving your fully customized mech between incoming attacks while unleashing a salvo of rocket fire, sword swipes, and plasma rounds.","content_length":658,"content_tokens":131,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/","date":"August 22, 2023 at 11:00AM PDT","content":"Put a few humans in outer space for a story set in the future and the result always seems to be that nothing will go their way. That's once again the broad strokes of this latest space thriller, Fort Solis, but the intrigue, as ever, is in the details. Developer Fallen Leaf does a good job of hiding the satisfying answers to its central mysteries up to the very end, which makes its story consistently absorbing even as some of its gameplay elements betray its own Hollywood-inspired intentions. Fort Solis is a third-person adventure game that tells a story reminiscent of Moon and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's slow, sometimes to a fault, and more concerned with its message and themes than action set-pieces. That doesn't mean it's a low-stakes tale. On the contrary, the secrets tucked away in Fort Solis are existential, but it's expressed through the eyes of a small cast of interesting characters whom you'll get to know over the game's five-hour story. Fort Solis has AAA aspirations, and it shows quite clearly in a few ways. For one, the game looks gorgeous. Built in Unreal Engine and presenting gameplay in an over-the-shoulder style, it would be easy to mistake this indie for the next big-budget cinematic thriller. That's further solidified by its exceptional cast headlined by Roger Clark and Troy Baker, but the complete cast of about 10 or so people is just as well-written and with great performances to match. Clark's Leary and Julia Brown's Jessica Appleton do well to color in the world in the first hour, including their own characters who would otherwise be amorphous Mars transplants in drab uniforms. Visually, Fort Solis is indistinguishable from a big-budget project. In Fort Solis' vision of the year 2080, we've yet to occupy Mars as a species, but corporations have made it a mining and research hub. I bet you can guess how that's going. As a skeleton crew stays behind to work what is essentially a weeks-long graveyard shift on the red planet, a distress call across the facility alerts Jack Leary to an issue within the titular research lab. The game ramps up its drama at a pace that pulled me right in, where early chit-chat and jokes over the radio with his scene partner, Julia Brown's Jessica Appleton, soon grew more stressed as doors appeared sabotaged, then dire as bodies started to pile up. Paced to unfold like a mini-series meant to be marathoned, the central question of what happened on Fort Solis is expertly hidden from full view for nearly the entire game. It's presented in a virtual one-shot style without any loading screens, doling out the next dangling thread at a pace that kept me both guessing and playing. I was impressed by how well it shielded the truth of the matter while simultaneously drip-feeding a lot of details over time. It does this largely through video-gamey methods: optional audio and video logs as well as emails. Though that approach is far from novel, it feels justified in this universe where workers are recording messages to send back to their families on Earth, or cataloging some of the facility's recent dangers to cover their own liability concerns. This ample number of optional clues led me to carefully examine everything I could find--for example, not just the words in an email, but the date it was sent, who wrote it, and whether I'd already seen the other side of the conversation. I was trying to reveal the magician's prestige before they presented it to me. I never did figure it out any sooner than I was meant to, which kept me engaged and ultimately satisfied. Like in a lot of games, it does feel like the story demands you dig through many of these optional clues to have it all make sense. According to in-game stats, I found 92% of all video logs, audio logs, and emails which collectively help flesh out the story considerably, but it seems a few more important details are hiding in that last 8%. Still, I also sense that some of the game's answers aren't found even there, and as someone who enjoys a lingering mystery, I happily made peace with that outcome. There are likely branches you might expect this story to travel down, such as hostile aliens, rogue AI, madness by way of isolation--the usual suspects of a creepy space station. I won't spoil anything here, but I will say that Fort Solis is both structured unlike other stories in this popular subgenre and also lands on a story that feels novel, while still keeping intact some of the more popular themes of dystopian futures. Its dramatic unveiling in the final act is both threatening on a massive scale and also so innocuous in its original intent that it's actually tragic. As some in the real world consider the prospect of colonizing Mars, Fort Solis examines why that's even on the table, what pitfalls that might include, and how even well-meaning people can cause catastrophe when we're grappling with the cosmos. It blurs the lines between heroes and villains in asking these questions, making characters complex and its ethical argument nuanced. Those strengths helped me push through some of the game's more frustrating bits related to its gameplay mechanics. Fort Solis is an adventure game, closer to something like Firewatch--complete with the woman on the radio chatting with you as you investigate anomalies--than it is Dead Space. There's nothing wrong with that, but there are a few missteps in its execution. Like a well-paced mini-series, it'll be tough to figure out the story's central mystery before you're intended to. Gallery For one, your character moves slowly to the point of frustration. This worsens when the game opens up, allowing for more exploration. I wanted to turn over every figurative stone so I didn't miss a clue as to what I was piecing together, but this often meant trekking slowly across expansive areas looking for interaction points where my character would comment on them. It was at its worst when I did all that slow walking and found nothing in various corners in the environment, leaving me empty-handed after wasting a few minutes at a time. It's as though the game wants to maintain control of its pacing and not let players run wildly across the terrain while its story is telling much more of a slow-burn sci-fi tale. I can appreciate that creative direction, but I still feel there was room to speed up player movement without sacrificing the cinematic presentation. Given that backtracking is sometimes built right into the story by way of the titular fort's tiered security clearance system you'll figuratively climb across its four chapters, this issue is blatant right away and only gets in the way more as the game goes on. For all the apparent want of a properly paced story, the slow movement speed hurts it more than a jog button would have. Even when you're going in the right direction, gameplay mechanics remain light. You'll have to solve some basic puzzles and nail a few quick-time-event sequences--or not, as there seems to be no penalty for failure. But for the most part, you'll just want to head in the right direction, as suggested by the story and the smartphone-like object strapped to your wrist. This makes gameplay less involved than even a Telltale game, as here there are no choices to be made, neither in the plot nor the dialogue. Unfortunately, that doesn't leave much in terms of engaging the player in a traditional gameplay sense. Thankfully, Fort Solis as a whole is stronger than its weakest parts. That's owed largely to its writing, which launches into well-tread ground and manages to subvert tropes in unexpected ways, not just with an ending that feels different, but with some narrative-structural alterations it makes along the way. It's always difficult to write about a game that hinges so much on a mystery I ought not reveal on its behalf, but suffice it to say that, though I could vaguely see its themes coming, the actual unfolding of the plot is unique and satisfying, and it left me with the ethical questions I was clearly meant to ponder--and still do as I write this review. Through fiction, I've traveled to one space station or another more times than I can count across many years and many forms of media. It's a setting I always enjoy--as an opening at least--and from there, stories may or may not keep me invested depending on what they do with that foundation. Fort Solis places a small but intriguing cast in its off-Earth saga in ways that can be familiar, but it justifies its addition to the subgenre with its own fun twists and philosophical arguments.","length":8544,"tokens":1773,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/","post_date":"August 22, 2023 at 11:00AM PDT","content":"Put a few humans in outer space for a story set in the future and the result always seems to be that nothing will go their way.

Its dramatic unveiling in the final act is both threatening on a massive scale and also so innocuous in its original intent that it's actually tragic. As some in the real world consider the prospect of colonizing Mars, Fort Solis examines why that's even on the table, what pitfalls that might include, and how even well-meaning people can cause catastrophe when we're grappling with the cosmos. It blurs the lines between heroes and villains in asking these questions, making characters complex and its ethical argument nuanced.

There's nothing wrong with that, but there are a few missteps in its execution. Like a well-paced mini-series, it'll be tough to figure out the story's central mystery before you're intended to. Gallery For one, your character moves slowly to the point of frustration. This worsens when the game opens up, allowing for more exploration. I wanted to turn over every figurative stone so I didn't miss a clue as to what I was piecing together, but this often meant trekking slowly across expansive areas looking for interaction points where my character would comment on them. It was at its worst when I did all that slow walking and found nothing in various corners in the environment, leaving me empty-handed after wasting a few minutes at a time.","content_length":923,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/","post_date":"August 22, 2023 at 11:00AM PDT","content":"It's as though the game wants to maintain control of its pacing and not let players run wildly across the terrain while its story is telling much more of a slow-burn sci-fi tale. I can appreciate that creative direction, but I still feel there was room to speed up player movement without sacrificing the cinematic presentation. Given that backtracking is sometimes built right into the story by way of the titular fort's tiered security clearance system you'll figuratively climb across its four chapters, this issue is blatant right away and only gets in the way more as the game goes on. For all the apparent want of a properly paced story, the slow movement speed hurts it more than a jog button would have. Even when you're going in the right direction, gameplay mechanics remain light. You'll have to solve some basic puzzles and nail a few quick-time-event sequences--or not, as there seems to be no penalty for failure.","content_length":927,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/","post_date":"August 22, 2023 at 11:00AM PDT","content":"But for the most part, you'll just want to head in the right direction, as suggested by the story and the smartphone-like object strapped to your wrist. This makes gameplay less involved than even a Telltale game, as here there are no choices to be made, neither in the plot nor the dialogue. Unfortunately, that doesn't leave much in terms of engaging the player in a traditional gameplay sense. Thankfully, Fort Solis as a whole is stronger than its weakest parts. That's owed largely to its writing, which launches into well-tread ground and manages to subvert tropes in unexpected ways, not just with an ending that feels different, but with some narrative-structural alterations it makes along the way.","content_length":707,"content_tokens":146,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/","post_date":"August 22, 2023 at 11:00AM PDT","content":"It's always difficult to write about a game that hinges so much on a mystery I ought not reveal on its behalf, but suffice it to say that, though I could vaguely see its themes coming, the actual unfolding of the plot is unique and satisfying, and it left me with the ethical questions I was clearly meant to ponder--and still do as I write this review. Through fiction, I've traveled to one space station or another more times than I can count across many years and many forms of media. It's a setting I always enjoy--as an opening at least--and from there, stories may or may not keep me invested depending on what they do with that foundation.

The focus for this first-person shooter, however, is still on blasting baddies, albeit with a variety of bullet-inspired spells instead of traditional firearms. And although all the shooting is exciting for the first half of the game, it becomes increasingly annoying in the latter half when firefights get longer and more frequent. These shoot-outs interrupt the story's momentum by dragging it out, curating an irritating sense of repetitive tedium. Though you're slinging spells in Immortals, the magic you're casting is more cosmetic flavoring to what is otherwise a fairly traditional military shooter. Red magic unleashes with all the concussive force of a shotgun while green magic slowly ramps with the heated ferocity of a light machine gun and blue magic slices through the air with the precision of a bolt-action rifle. You switch between them at the push of the button, though annoyingly only in a cycle of blue to red to green and back to blue. There's no way to immediately leapfrog to the magic you need. The lack of a quality-of-life feature as mainstream as a weapon wheel is quite noticeable in Immortals, which sees you frequently switch between your three equipped styles of magic. Not only does each color of magic fire differently, many enemies are armored against all but one color, meaning you need to oftentimes switch to a specific color when focusing on a new target. Early into the game, when you're only fighting a handful of enemies at a time, this drawback isn't that noticeable. But once you get far enough into Immortals' story, you find yourself fighting wave after wave of dozen-odd enemies, each of which requires a specific color of magic to defeat. And having to cycle through the animation of summoning green magic just to have the option to switch to the blue magic I need can be costly in as fast-paced a shooter as Immortals, where enemies hit hard and nimbly move about the battlefield. A carefully lined-up shot may no longer be there by the time you switch to the needed color. Your considerations don't just end at what color magic you're using, either, as you're outfitted with several arcane tools and powerful special spells that serve their own purposes. Those include a piercing red laser that can disrupt enemy spellcasters from using magic, an explosive wave of cascading rocks that breaks shields, floating lipids that latch onto and slow down fast-moving targets, and a shield that blocks incoming fire. All of these--and more--have their own cooldowns, and most you need to manually switch to in order to use while the rest require you to recharge them with the consumption of an item. It's a lot to keep track of and switch between, especially on a gamepad controller. My entire playthrough on PlayStation 5 left me wishing I was playing the game on PC, where presumably all of these tools and abilities are mapped to individual keys on a keyboard. Enemy design doesn't encourage you to play all that strategically beyond color-coded combos. Melee-focused enemies pursue you with reckless abandon, incentivizing you to pick them off from a distance before they close in. Meanwhile, spellcasters and archers dart about on the outskirts, dancing out of view and blasting you from your blindspots, encouraging you to find ways of bringing them in close to then blast them away. Despite these differing approaches, however, all enemies are dealt with in the same way: shooting them with their matching color. All of the strategy in Immortals is tied to matching the right color to the right enemy, lessening the importance of positioning, cover, movement, and other skills typically rewarded in shooters. If a massive, punching creature is running towards me in red armor, for example, it doesn't matter if I try to carefully position myself where they can't reach me and snipe at them from afar with my long-range blue magic. Their armor is red--I have to wait for them to close on me to use the shotgun-like red magic to break that armor. My ability to strategize and try to overcome an enemy's weaknesses are often dashed in the face of whatever armor an enemy is using. This is exacerbated by the environments, which are visually distinct but largely designed as big, open spaces with several raised platforms on the outskirts and a few columns of cover scattered throughout. Sometimes there's a bottomless pit or two you have to double-jump over for a little extra flavor. But every battle quickly begins to feel the same, the only difference being that more enemies are being added later, which results in the aforementioned feeling of being overwhelmed, not necessarily challenged. It feels especially telling that Immortals' idea of a difficulty curve is to introduce a tough miniboss early on and then have you later face the exact same miniboss but with other enemies fighting you too, and then again you face two of that same miniboss and some other enemies, and then finally you face an extra large version of the miniboss with a giant health bar while smaller enemies distract you on the side. The challenge is evolving, yes, but only in terms of the number of times you have to switch what color magic you're using. And granted, this type of increasing challenge is typical for most shooters, where you're expected to better strategize and master your weaponry over time to deal with the increasing number of threats. Immortals' difficulty isn't as rewarding to overcome, however, because the untenable task of weapon switching is constrained in an unfair way. Within the frantic whirlwind of Immortals' heated combat, keeping on top of everything that you need in order to progress through a fight is oftentimes frustrating. I appreciate the almost puzzle-like nature that Immortals is presumably striving for, where getting through a firefight isn't solely dependent on how well you shoot but also on figuring out what you need to use and in what order. And in the early hours of the game, this formula works quite well. It's only later, when Immortals' idea of combat difficulty is reduced to the simple idea of just throwing more enemies with larger health bars at the player, that this concept falls apart. The sheer number of variables to keep track of while splitting your fire between several quick-moving bullet sponges is overwhelming, regularly leading to irritating deaths that forced me to put down the game and cool off for a few hours before trying again. And, again, I suspect this shortcoming is less severe on a PC with a mouse and keyboard but having only played on consoles, I can't say for sure either way. It all just feels like you're bashing your head against the same wall and only losing because you're unable to switch between all your weapons quickly enough to put enough damage into everything fast enough.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4150713-4124782-ioa_rvl_shield. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4150713-4124782-ioa_rvl_shield. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4150713-4124782-ioa_rvl_shield. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Immortals' story is also mediocre, but it at least ventures into some interesting topics. You play as Jak, a soldier who's special because he can use all three colors of magic whereas the Average Joe can only use one. You're fighting in a war that's been going on so long that no one can really remember how it started, but both sides know that whoever wins gets control of all the magic in the world and neither army is willing to back down for fear of losing access to the most powerful resource on the planet. The story runs through the paces of your typical military shooter. You've got a protagonist motivated by tragedy, a commanding officer who likes you despite your rebellious attitude, and two main squadmates: a lovable ride-or-die homie and an antagonistic ally who constantly looks down upon you and demeans your worth with a lousy nickname. There's a masked villain who mysteriously just appeared one day and displays the same capacity for using all three colors of magic as well, setting up what's positioned as a shocking reveal (it's not). There's some comfort in that familiarity, but it's in how Immortals subverts the expectations of where the story is expected to go that it becomes most intriguing. At the core of Immortals' story is the idea of environmentalism and the costly nature of a war that continues as the result of human greed. Upon learning how humanity's war has caused the extinction of hundreds of fauna and flora species and will continue to make the world increasingly uninhabitable, Jak strives to be the voice of reason in the room and convince enemies and allies alike to give peace a chance. It's an initially interesting development, and seeing Jak take his more power-hungry superiors to task and confront the logical fallacies in both his enemies' and allies' positions creates absorbing drama among the characters. I regularly found myself snooping through discovered text logs and pieces of Immortals' lore to better understand the full scope of the history that had led to such a climactic moment and wanting to see what would happen next to uncover whether Jak could pull off the peace he was chasing.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Unfortunately, the environmental element of Immortals has both poor gameplay and narrative payoffs. To cleanse the world, you just do more shooting and killing--Jak can rip away more magic from the world to fuel his spells to then battle against the deadly sentient miasma that's consuming the world, knowing that this miasma is created whenever magic is being taken from the world. It's a tantalizingly complex dilemma that Immortals just refuses to delve into after setting it up. And even though he's positioned as the voice of reason and a revolutionary in how he thinks about the war, Jak's wisdom is dashed halfway through the story with him making a bizarre decision that goes against much of his character development up to that point. When presented with an easy way of ending the conflict and sundering both sides' incessant need to control magic, Jak opts to... not make that choice. In fact, he does the exact opposite--a costly mistake that feels uncharacteristic of his seemingly intelligent grasp of the morality of the situation. As a result, you spend most of the latter half of the story striving to make amends for this bad call, but it just reinforces how badly Jak screwed up and how odd that he didn't recognize the clear hypocrisy in his actions that resulted in more war. It pushes him away from being a likable protagonist to being an oddly written and ultimately despicable one. And it's hard to play as someone you dislike. The whole thing feels less like character development and more like a way to strangely justify there being a second half of the story and making the whole experience twice as long as it probably needed to be. Immortals of Aveum stops just short of fully complementing its traditional military shooter story with an engaging environmentalist message, instead opting to primarily use those narrative themes to inform the world design and lore. It leaves the overall story feeling half-baked, further highlighting the uncharacteristic actions of its unlikable protagonist. The actual shooting fares a bit better, especially in the first half, when combat is more like a color-coded puzzle. But it, too, falls short--the repeated use of enemies and arena layouts make for repetitive firefights and the sheer number of combat options is difficult to navigate when combat reaches an overwhelming fervor. I enjoyed small pieces of Immortals of Aveum, but not enough to strongly recommend.","length":12407,"tokens":2678,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Immortals Of Aveum Review - Run And Gun","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 9:00PM PDT","content":"At first, Immortals of Aveum pleasantly surprised me, putting a lot more stock into its narrative themes of environmentalism than I expected its wartime story to cover.

I regularly found myself snooping through discovered text logs and pieces of Immortals' lore to better understand the full scope of the history that had led to such a climactic moment and wanting to see what would happen next to uncover whether Jak could pull off the peace he was chasing.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4181329-im2.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Immortals Of Aveum Review - Run And Gun","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 9:00PM PDT","content":"png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4181329-im2. png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Unfortunately, the environmental element of Immortals has both poor gameplay and narrative payoffs.","content_length":430,"content_tokens":154,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Immortals Of Aveum Review - Run And Gun","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 9:00PM PDT","content":"To cleanse the world, you just do more shooting and killing--Jak can rip away more magic from the world to fuel his spells to then battle against the deadly sentient miasma that's consuming the world, knowing that this miasma is created whenever magic is being taken from the world. It's a tantalizingly complex dilemma that Immortals just refuses to delve into after setting it up. And even though he's positioned as the voice of reason and a revolutionary in how he thinks about the war, Jak's wisdom is dashed halfway through the story with him making a bizarre decision that goes against much of his character development up to that point. When presented with an easy way of ending the conflict and sundering both sides' incessant need to control magic, Jak opts to.. not make that choice. In fact, he does the exact opposite--a costly mistake that feels uncharacteristic of his seemingly intelligent grasp of the morality of the situation.","content_length":944,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Immortals Of Aveum Review - Run And Gun","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 9:00PM PDT","content":"As a result, you spend most of the latter half of the story striving to make amends for this bad call, but it just reinforces how badly Jak screwed up and how odd that he didn't recognize the clear hypocrisy in his actions that resulted in more war. It pushes him away from being a likable protagonist to being an oddly written and ultimately despicable one. And it's hard to play as someone you dislike. The whole thing feels less like character development and more like a way to strangely justify there being a second half of the story and making the whole experience twice as long as it probably needed to be. Immortals of Aveum stops just short of fully complementing its traditional military shooter story with an engaging environmentalist message, instead opting to primarily use those narrative themes to inform the world design and lore. It leaves the overall story feeling half-baked, further highlighting the uncharacteristic actions of its unlikable protagonist. The actual shooting fares a bit better, especially in the first half, when combat is more like a color-coded puzzle. But it, too, falls short--the repeated use of enemies and arena layouts make for repetitive firefights and the sheer number of combat options is difficult to navigate when combat reaches an overwhelming fervor. I enjoyed small pieces of Immortals of Aveum, but not enough to strongly recommend.","content_length":1385,"content_tokens":273,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Madden NFL 24 Review - One Yard Forward, Two Yards Back","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/","date":"August 21, 2023 at 1:58PM PDT","content":"One of my fondest memories as a football fan is Chris Johnson's 2,000-yard season in 2009. As arguably the fastest player the league has ever seen, the running back forever known as CJ2K was a one-man highlight reel, turning would-be six-yard gains into 50+ yard touchdowns all season long. But if you watch those highlights, you'll find a common theme: Titans wideout Kenny Britt was so often downfield blocking, creating vital running lanes through which CJ would weave with his unrivaled quickness. Britt is an unsung hero of CJ's historic season. In Madden 24, it's been great to find players can now enjoy similarly helpful downfield blocking like never before. This fix to the running game is precisely the sort of tangible improvement I hope for with every new Madden game. But examples such as this are overshadowed by a lack of major additions to Madden's suite of features and modes. That improvement to blocking has been a minor bullet point of EA's marketing in the run-up to release and is known as the Tactical Blocking System, essentially referring to an overhaul of how the AI linemen and other blockers target which defenders to remove from the play. This is easily my favorite new toy in Madden as its changes are apparent and make the ground game, or running after the catch, much more lifelike than before. But the publisher didn't hype up this change as much as others. Instead, EA buried this highlight behind two returning features: minigames and Superstar mode. In neither case is their return nearly as helpful or interesting as some of the on-field tweaks. In the case of minigames, I find their return to be uneven at best. On one hand, a full Training Camp simulation that gives Franchise players a faster track to player improvements is at least rewarding, but the minigames themselves range from fun and clever to boring and simple. With bronze, silver, and gold medals correlating to XP earned for the player, it's worth playing for the XP attached to those awards, but some of the minigames are much better or worse than others. Fixes to blocking, particularly in the running game, amount to my favorite change found within Madden 24. The rushing attack minigame, for example, is an easy gold medal every single time. In about 15 or 20 rushing attempts I'm able to perform within the time limit, I've scored touchdowns on almost every single one, every single time. This makes the minigame a mindless but necessary timesink, as skipping these practice sessions automatically awards players with a bronze medal and much less XP. Still, I enjoy Training Camp overall as it becomes a new part of the team-building process every offseason. I had a legitimate camp battle for the starting QB job, which I decided thanks to not just preseason games, but Training Camp too. The bigger issue is how these minigames now pop up every week in practice sessions. Setting aside an hour or two for Training Camp before each season is enjoyable enough. Going back to manually performing weekly practice drills after years of the game automating them is a slog due to the aforementioned issue of how much the quality varies in these minigames. I can stomach doing the mindless rushing attack minigame once a season, but to do it every single week gets old fast. I was hardly out of the preseason of my first year in Franchise when I decided I'd take the hit on XP gains and just started simulating these drills. Another oddity of Franchise mode is sweeping changes to team relocation and renaming. More cities have been added, including several new international cities, and the longtime fake teams seen in-game, like the Huskies and the Dragons, have been given aesthetic makeovers. In most cases, these new jerseys look better than they did for the past several years, but in practice, the focus on tuning these elements so much feels out of place. Like last year's Madden memorial game, most players will only participate in team relocation once or never. It feels like a lot of time and effort spent on something so unrelated to the actual league. This dissonance only widens when you consider that the visual overhauls were treated with only a half-measure. I moved my team to Portland and dressed them in the midnight blue and gold jerseys of the fictional Night Hawks, but player gear such as gloves, arm sleeves, and wristbands, was still displaying the Night Hawks' purple and orange jersey colors of older Maddens, from before the makeover. This made my players look like mismatched kids who dressed themselves for school. Even if I removed those optional cosmetic features from every player on my team so as not to disrupt the color scheme, everyone necessarily wears cleats, and these too are colored wrongly. Fake teams got uniform overhauls, but player gear still sports the past color schemes. It's also weird that the game displays all sorts of business-related numbers to a team considering a move--how much fan demand there is in a different city, how much the stadium will cost, how much the state will help pay for it--when none of these factors matter unless someone is playing Franchise in owner mode, something very few do relative to just playing as a coach or player. Like minigames, Superstar mode is back. It never exactly left the game--the team tried a more authored story called Longshot a half-decade ago, but when that didn't work, it introduced Face of the Franchise, a Superstar-light mode. Now, Superstar returns in name with some welcome, NBA 2K-style overhauls. A better rewards track and real-time player grading system are nice additions, even as they're not novel to the sports sim world, but the recurring issue of bland story content is present, as it virtually always has been. In Madden 24's Superstar mode, the narrative is little more than a live-action video podcast hosted by former players who perform bad line reads as they lightly touch on your created athlete's career goings-on every few in-game weeks, such as when you're drafted, win the starting job, or move to a new team. The centerpiece of this mode should be improving your player from a 70-something overall backup to a 99 Club Super Bowl MVP. And though playing games and working toward that long-term goal is enjoyable on a basic level, too much happens in the menus between games, like electing to make a viral video to enhance your status as a celebrity athlete, or work out on your day off for a bonus to one attribute or another come gameday. But these \"events\" are simply text-based options in a menu, all while your athlete is shown in the background endlessly gaming on his TV in a small bedroom. It very much feels like a mode that could grow over the years to come, and may eventually give EA its rival to NBA 2K's The City, a busy social space full of different game modes--and, of course, microtransaction offers. But today, it's not nearly that involved.<img alt=\"Superstar Showdown cosmetics are as desperate to stick out as a car plastered in bumper stickers.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4181304-maddennfl242023-08-2012-54-27. png\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4181304-maddennfl242023-08-2012-54-27. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4181304-maddennfl242023-08-2012-54-27. png 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4181304-maddennfl242023-08-2012-54-27. png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Superstar Showdown cosmetics are as desperate to stick out as a car plastered in bumper stickers. Like in past years with Face of the Franchise and The Yard working in tandem as the custom-player modes, Superstar also shares the stage with Superstar Showdown, a flashier version of The Yard's 3v3 game mode that is meant to play more like a pick-up game at the park than an actual NFL sim. But all that's new here is the field moving indoors to an eyesore of a warehouse full of enough strobe lights to merit an impromptu rave. It's so colorful and busily lit that it actually distracts from the simplistic 3v3 football taking place. Superstar Showdown, like Superstar itself, feels like a sliver of a future mode that may justify its existence. Today, it does not nearly do that. Its only saving grace is that it can level the same created athlete that you are using in Superstar mode proper, but that does require playing Superstar Showdown, which I cannot recommend. Played as first-to-21 backyard-style games, the 3v3 mode is most often a shootout, where both teams score nearly at will. Touches like behind-the-back passes and a bevy of emotes for sale give the game its intended youthful vibe, but it feels like every game unfolds predictably and there's no strategy built into it: Throw it deep, make a guy miss, do a dance, repeat. This mode also allows for the sale of uniform cosmetics, but those in the shop out of the gate are wildly unappealing, going so overboard in an effort to be eye-popping that they come off looking quite like bad Tron fanfic. Madden Ultimate Team (MUT) returns in such a state that I can hardly point to anything that's new about it. In terms of the overall game, I find that to be an addition by way of stagnation, though, as for too long it's seemed, from the outside looking in, like MUT has swallowed up too many resources from other aspects of the game. Still, for players who genuinely enjoy this mode, they'll find nothing here that wasn't before. New cards replace old cards, but the pull of paying for a team rather than building a team is as strong as ever, with no apparent money-saving techniques newly unveiled. Madden 24 does not make major improvements, but rather subtle ones that I appreciate as a football fan. The team promises more seasons than before--seven versus five--but this just makes the game more of a mad dash to the meta-dominant cards, thereby further vying to become the only game that one may have time for if they commit to staying competitive. This is expressed worst of all by there being some rewards in the Field Pass only awarded to the first 1,000 players to earn them. Solo Battles remain limited to just four per day, while the best cards take an exorbitant amount of time to unlock, thereby purposely enticing in-game purchases to cut the line. Given the incredible amount of money coming into this mode, it feels like the team could be more generous and likely lose nothing while gaining some goodwill. But that's just not in the cards, apparently. These issues I've detailed here are major and wide-ranging but related mostly to the game's breadth of modes, which is too bad since the on-field product continues to improve. I feel Madden 23's gameplay was the best in years, and Madden 24 is noticeably better than that, thanks not just to the blocking enhancements I mentioned, but also to other aspects of the game. Pass catchers, for example, now catch the ball in stride better than before, which results in long streaks going for touchdowns in ways they should've last year. Delivering a Hit Stick tackle is slightly less sticky, which helps defenders not deliver them as often, especially in PvP where it was once an overly reliable way to force fumbles. In these small but appreciable ways, it feels like the team's foundational overhaul last year, Fieldsense, has been refined in its second season, though Madden 24 lacks a major enhancement on the level of last year's Skill-Based Passing. To be fair, I'd say that's probably the game's best new addition since 2005, though, so it was a high bar to clear. Still, Madden 24 does not make major improvements, but rather subtle ones that I appreciate as a football fan. The series isn't taking the same-sized leaps forward of other games in this genre. It's the only NFL sim on the market, but all major sports games share a key detail in common: the annual release cycle. It can't be easy, but non-football games are making greater strides in mimicking their respective sports than Madden is at mimicking football. Graded against itself, Madden 24 is best-in-class on the field. But when stacked up against other sports sims, Madden is clearly lagging behind. Another legacy issue of this series is presentation. Sports gamers want their games to look and sound like the real thing. To my memory, Madden has never really come close to achieving this, and though recent efforts have inched toward that thanks to a solid booth featuring Charles Davis and Brandon Gaudin, improvements have stagnated in recent years. The aesthetic of the scoreboard gets redone every year, but commentary remains stale and often gets things wrong or says inane things, like a team having qualified for the playoffs after having won a playoff game, or Gaudin saying a team \"is 7-2 on the season and has won seven of its last nine games.\"Player introductions, camera work, and the general atmosphere of a Madden game don't resemble what spectators see on autumn Sundays, and while so much else about making this particular game is obviously difficult, it's easy to compare a Madden game's presentation to that on CBS or Fox and plainly see they are not similar enough for the former to be immersive.<img alt=\"Despite a range of issues elsewhere in Madden, the actual football gameplay continues to trend upward.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Despite a range of issues elsewhere in Madden, the actual football gameplay continues to trend upward. If a football fan only wants to know whether this year's game plays better than last year's on the field, it surely does. But the problems Madden 24 faces are emblematic of its legacy: a long history of backtracking to old features. This is far from the first time that features were introduced, removed, and later revived. But few years of Madden in recent memory have felt as hamstrung by its unforgiving development cycle as this one. It makes me wonder if we're still seeing the effects of delays and disruptment from the pandemic. Madden 24 is a paradox. I would not want to revert to a previous year's game simply because the on-field gameplay is clearly better, while virtually everything surrounding its best attribute feels incomplete or undesirable. It feels as though Madden is now like a team with a star quarterback surrounded by a bad offensive line, unreliable wideouts, and a porous defense. There is greatness to appreciate here, but in the prime of its career, Madden 24 is being held back by a roster not able to compete at a high level.","length":14931,"tokens":3325,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Madden NFL 24 Review - One Yard Forward, Two Yards Back","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 1:58PM PDT","content":"One of my fondest memories as a football fan is Chris Johnson's 2,000-yard season in 2009.

Like in past years with Face of the Franchise and The Yard working in tandem as the custom-player modes, Superstar also shares the stage with Superstar Showdown, a flashier version of The Yard's 3v3 game mode that is meant to play more like a pick-up game at the park than an actual NFL sim. But all that's new here is the field moving indoors to an eyesore of a warehouse full of enough strobe lights to merit an impromptu rave. It's so colorful and busily lit that it actually distracts from the simplistic 3v3 football taking place.

Its only saving grace is that it can level the same created athlete that you are using in Superstar mode proper, but that does require playing Superstar Showdown, which I cannot recommend. Played as first-to-21 backyard-style games, the 3v3 mode is most often a shootout, where both teams score nearly at will. Touches like behind-the-back passes and a bevy of emotes for sale give the game its intended youthful vibe, but it feels like every game unfolds predictably and there's no strategy built into it: Throw it deep, make a guy miss, do a dance, repeat. This mode also allows for the sale of uniform cosmetics, but those in the shop out of the gate are wildly unappealing, going so overboard in an effort to be eye-popping that they come off looking quite like bad Tron fanfic.","content_length":817,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Madden NFL 24 Review - One Yard Forward, Two Yards Back","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 1:58PM PDT","content":"Madden Ultimate Team (MUT) returns in such a state that I can hardly point to anything that's new about it.

Still, for players who genuinely enjoy this mode, they'll find nothing here that wasn't before.

This is expressed worst of all by there being some rewards in the Field Pass only awarded to the first 1,000 players to earn them. Solo Battles remain limited to just four per day, while the best cards take an exorbitant amount of time to unlock, thereby purposely enticing in-game purchases to cut the line. Given the incredible amount of money coming into this mode, it feels like the team could be more generous and likely lose nothing while gaining some goodwill. But that's just not in the cards, apparently.

Pass catchers, for example, now catch the ball in stride better than before, which results in long streaks going for touchdowns in ways they should've last year. Delivering a Hit Stick tackle is slightly less sticky, which helps defenders not deliver them as often, especially in PvP where it was once an overly reliable way to force fumbles. In these small but appreciable ways, it feels like the team's foundational overhaul last year, Fieldsense, has been refined in its second season, though Madden 24 lacks a major enhancement on the level of last year's Skill-Based Passing.

The series isn't taking the same-sized leaps forward of other games in this genre.

It can't be easy, but non-football games are making greater strides in mimicking their respective sports than Madden is at mimicking football. Graded against itself, Madden 24 is best-in-class on the field. But when stacked up against other sports sims, Madden is clearly lagging behind. Another legacy issue of this series is presentation. Sports gamers want their games to look and sound like the real thing. To my memory, Madden has never really come close to achieving this, and though recent efforts have inched toward that thanks to a solid booth featuring Charles Davis and Brandon Gaudin, improvements have stagnated in recent years.","content_length":955,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Madden NFL 24 Review - One Yard Forward, Two Yards Back","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 1:58PM PDT","content":"The aesthetic of the scoreboard gets redone every year, but commentary remains stale and often gets things wrong or says inane things, like a team having qualified for the playoffs after having won a playoff game, or Gaudin saying a team \"is 7-2 on the season and has won seven of its last nine games.\"Player introductions, camera work, and the general atmosphere of a Madden game don't resemble what spectators see on autumn Sundays, and while so much else about making this particular game is obviously difficult, it's easy to compare a Madden game's presentation to that on CBS or Fox and plainly see they are not similar enough for the former to be immersive.<img alt=\"Despite a range of issues elsewhere in Madden, the actual football gameplay continues to trend upward.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.","content_length":885,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Madden NFL 24 Review - One Yard Forward, Two Yards Back","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/","post_date":"August 21, 2023 at 1:58PM PDT","content":"gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4176264-49ers. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Despite a range of issues elsewhere in Madden, the actual football gameplay continues to trend upward.

I would not want to revert to a previous year's game simply because the on-field gameplay is clearly better, while virtually everything surrounding its best attribute feels incomplete or undesirable. It feels as though Madden is now like a team with a star quarterback surrounded by a bad offensive line, unreliable wideouts, and a porous defense.

Blasphemous 2 sees the Seville-based studio delve further into Andalusian and Spanish culture, iconography, and folklore to concoct a gothic, quasi-Catholic world that's as gruesome as it is fascinating.

Much of its heady lore can be interpreted from dialogue with friendly NPCs and loquacious item descriptions, but if you're anything like me, you'll need an in-depth lore video to fully grasp it all. Nevertheless, the setup is rather simple. Picking up right where Blasphemous' Wounds of Eventide DLC left off, Blasphemous 2 begins with the return of the all-powerful deity known as The Miracle, who is prophesied to give birth to a so-called miracle child. This forces The Penitent One to awaken from his final resting place in order to slay the unholy newborn and every other grotesque monstrosity in his path. Along the way, myriad NPCs will shine a faint light on the mysterious new world the Penitent One finds himself in and its hidden secrets, but only if you choose to seek out these ancillary threads. Much like the inscrutable fables of From Software, you'll only take out as much as you're willing to put in. This style of storytelling isn't for everyone, but even if you can't or aren't willing to comprehend all of its machinations, the tales you do fully engage with are likely to engross. Upon emerging from his grandiose coffin, your first task as The Penitent One is to pick a starting weapon. There are three distinct options to choose from, starting with the most powerful of the three, named Veredicto. This hefty flail has both a long reach and wide arc, making it perfect for smiting enemies without venturing too close. It's not the quickest armament, but its sheer power increases your chances of stunning enemies, thus leaving them open for a stylish execution kill. Once you've generated enough Fervour--which is Blasphemous 2's version of mana--you can also set Veredicto alight for a short while, letting you singe enemies with additional burn damage. On the opposite side of the spectrum are Sarmiento & Centella, lightning-fast dual blades that swap strength for speed. Equipping this pair also allows you to block incoming attacks, making it particularly useful for fighting up close and personal. Ruego Al Alba, on the other hand, represents a middle ground between the two extremes of the other options. This blade is the most balanced of the three and also gives you the ability to counter incoming strikes provided your timing is on point. Whichever weapon you choose will dictate which paths you can access at the start of the game, since each one has a unique traversal skill associated with it. This adds consequences to your agency in making this decision, but it's ultimately shallow since it doesn't take long until all three weapons are in your possession. Introducing three varied weapons is a considerable step in the right direction when it comes to improving upon Blasphemous' one-note combat. The Game Kitchen doesn't just stop there, though. Skill trees for each weapon create a palpable sense of progression as you unlock additional techniques and combos throughout the game. Since all three weapons have their own strengths and drawbacks, it's unlikely you'll cling to a single tool for an entire playthrough. Picking the right weapon in the right circumstance is key to overcoming the plethora of enemy types Blasphemous 2 throws at you. Whether it's a mage conjuring fire spells from his bed while some poor, hapless saps hold him aloft, or a giant armored creature wielding a poison-coated hammer. Each sprite is wonderfully animated, and enemies tend to tear themselves asunder when felled, which never loses its luster. There's also a satisfying cadence to the way combat flows, as enemies strike with clearly signposted attacks. Death is never too far away if you're sloppy--perhaps by gambling on an extra attack or mistiming an evasive slide--but defeating each foe comes down to knowing their movesets and being precise in your actions, lending most encounters an exciting back-and-forth tempo. Much like the first game, Blasphemous 2's boss fights are a highlight, pitting you against a menagerie of varied and challenging foes. Some require the accuracy to recognize and then time when to avoid incoming melee strikes, while others take a page out of the Bullet Hell playbook by bombarding you with a dizzying array of projectiles. Memorizing which moves can be blocked and which need to be dashed through or jumped over is another age-old element of these intense bouts, but there's also variety found within this familiar framework. One fight, for example, sees you battling on a pair of undulating chandeliers, forcing you to jump between them in order to chase down the boss or avoid their attacks. The only downside to these clashes are the unskippable cutscenes that typically kickstart each one. They're usually fairly short, but when you're attempting the same fight multiple times, it doesn't take long for tedium to kick in. This emphasis on precision is also reflected in Blasphemous 2's numerous platforming challenges. They begin simply enough when you're limited to a single jump and one weapon ability, but The Game Kitchen has fully embraced the Metroidvana rulebook this time around, so new traversal moves are gradually doled out as you progress through the game. You'll discover plenty of dead ends that need to be revisited once the requisite ability has been unlocked, and as I mentioned before, each of the three weapons has its own unique ability associated with it as well. Veredicto, for instance, can be used to strike these magical floating bells to unleash a soundwave that opens up specific doors and reveals hidden platforms. Yet you also gain access to other familiar abilities like a double-jump and air-dash, to the point where you're utilizing multiple abilities one after another to traverse a single room, swapping between weapons on the fly to reveal hidden platforms and destroy blockades. It sometimes feels decidedly old school, harkening back to some of the best 2D platformers where a jumping puzzle is as engaging as a frantic battle against multiple foes. Blasphemous 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, mixing its unique and harrowing aesthetic with a gameplay amalgam of Metroidvanias and Souls-likes. Where the first game faltered, however, its sequel makes significant improvements, resulting in a thrilling adventure that doesn't run out of steam. As you gain access to more areas of the map, you'll also begin to uncover complementary items that can be equipped to enhance The Penitent One's skillset. Prayers--which function as magical attacks--are now a viable alternative to simply cutting everything down with a melee weapon, proving much more useful in combat than they were in the first game due to an increase in damage output. You can equip two of these potent Prayers at a time, which range from short bursts of fire to sizeable beams of mystical energy. Rosary Beads also return, allowing you to increase your resistance to specific damage types. Most notable, however, is the presence of a sculptor in the game's hub area. This humble craftsman gives you access to a slew of different figures that confer powerful benefits when placed upon the altarpiece on your back. You might find a figure that increases the stun power of your attacks, another that reduces the cooldown of your dodge, or one that improves the effect of healing items. How you align each sculpture on the altarpiece also matters, since certain figures react with one another to create additional perks. I placed two together that aligned to form another power, whereby executing an enemy would halt the passage of time for a few seconds. This proved especially useful when confronted with multiple foes, and is just one example of how these ancillary items can have a significant impact on Blasphemous 2's combat. There are a number of vendors located in the aforementioned hub area and beyond, allowing you to upgrade your health, hand over a knot to unlock another Rosary Bead, or simply purchase items. However, each one is spread out far enough--with doors, ladders, and teleportation devices in between them--that there's some notable downtime whenever you need to visit a few in succession. This process wouldn't be quite so tedious if they were closer together. You also can't teleport between the bonfire-esque checkpoints you'll unlock across the map, instead only being able to quickly move between a few designated points, so there's a fair amount of backtracking involved that usually revolves around avoiding every enemy in your path. This is par for the course in Metroidvanias, but it feels unnecessary when the gameplay in between adds nothing of value. Even with these issues, Blasphemous 2 is an excellent sequel that improves upon its predecessor in almost all of the ways it fell short. The addition of three new weapons--and the litany of ways you can augment your build--ensure that combat is engaging throughout, while traversal has also been expanded upon in positive ways, removing much of the previous frustration by focusing on satisfying challenges and a tangible sense of progression. Combine this with another fascinating setting and deluge of haunting imagery, and this is a pilgrimage worth embarking on.","length":12785,"tokens":2774,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"Whether it's a giant woman willfully letting the Children of Moonlight deglove one of her hands; a bearded man leaking golden honey out of gaping wounds in his palms, face, and back; or a vendor that's simply an arm protruding from a towering pile of goods, developer The Game Kitchen has a knack for creating surreal pixel art imagery.

Nevertheless, the setup is rather simple. Picking up right where Blasphemous' Wounds of Eventide DLC left off, Blasphemous 2 begins with the return of the all-powerful deity known as The Miracle, who is prophesied to give birth to a so-called miracle child. This forces The Penitent One to awaken from his final resting place in order to slay the unholy newborn and every other grotesque monstrosity in his path. Along the way, myriad NPCs will shine a faint light on the mysterious new world the Penitent One finds himself in and its hidden secrets, but only if you choose to seek out these ancillary threads.","content_length":809,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"Much like the inscrutable fables of From Software, you'll only take out as much as you're willing to put in. This style of storytelling isn't for everyone, but even if you can't or aren't willing to comprehend all of its machinations, the tales you do fully engage with are likely to engross. Upon emerging from his grandiose coffin, your first task as The Penitent One is to pick a starting weapon. There are three distinct options to choose from, starting with the most powerful of the three, named Veredicto. This hefty flail has both a long reach and wide arc, making it perfect for smiting enemies without venturing too close. It's not the quickest armament, but its sheer power increases your chances of stunning enemies, thus leaving them open for a stylish execution kill.","content_length":780,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"Once you've generated enough Fervour--which is Blasphemous 2's version of mana--you can also set Veredicto alight for a short while, letting you singe enemies with additional burn damage. On the opposite side of the spectrum are Sarmiento & Centella, lightning-fast dual blades that swap strength for speed. Equipping this pair also allows you to block incoming attacks, making it particularly useful for fighting up close and personal. Ruego Al Alba, on the other hand, represents a middle ground between the two extremes of the other options. This blade is the most balanced of the three and also gives you the ability to counter incoming strikes provided your timing is on point. Whichever weapon you choose will dictate which paths you can access at the start of the game, since each one has a unique traversal skill associated with it.","content_length":840,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"This adds consequences to your agency in making this decision, but it's ultimately shallow since it doesn't take long until all three weapons are in your possession. Introducing three varied weapons is a considerable step in the right direction when it comes to improving upon Blasphemous' one-note combat. The Game Kitchen doesn't just stop there, though. Skill trees for each weapon create a palpable sense of progression as you unlock additional techniques and combos throughout the game. Since all three weapons have their own strengths and drawbacks, it's unlikely you'll cling to a single tool for an entire playthrough. Picking the right weapon in the right circumstance is key to overcoming the plethora of enemy types Blasphemous 2 throws at you.

There's also a satisfying cadence to the way combat flows, as enemies strike with clearly signposted attacks. Death is never too far away if you're sloppy--perhaps by gambling on an extra attack or mistiming an evasive slide--but defeating each foe comes down to knowing their movesets and being precise in your actions, lending most encounters an exciting back-and-forth tempo. Much like the first game, Blasphemous 2's boss fights are a highlight, pitting you against a menagerie of varied and challenging foes. Some require the accuracy to recognize and then time when to avoid incoming melee strikes, while others take a page out of the Bullet Hell playbook by bombarding you with a dizzying array of projectiles.","content_length":841,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"Memorizing which moves can be blocked and which need to be dashed through or jumped over is another age-old element of these intense bouts, but there's also variety found within this familiar framework. One fight, for example, sees you battling on a pair of undulating chandeliers, forcing you to jump between them in order to chase down the boss or avoid their attacks. The only downside to these clashes are the unskippable cutscenes that typically kickstart each one. They're usually fairly short, but when you're attempting the same fight multiple times, it doesn't take long for tedium to kick in. This emphasis on precision is also reflected in Blasphemous 2's numerous platforming challenges. They begin simply enough when you're limited to a single jump and one weapon ability, but The Game Kitchen has fully embraced the Metroidvana rulebook this time around, so new traversal moves are gradually doled out as you progress through the game.","content_length":949,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"You'll discover plenty of dead ends that need to be revisited once the requisite ability has been unlocked, and as I mentioned before, each of the three weapons has its own unique ability associated with it as well. Veredicto, for instance, can be used to strike these magical floating bells to unleash a soundwave that opens up specific doors and reveals hidden platforms. Yet you also gain access to other familiar abilities like a double-jump and air-dash, to the point where you're utilizing multiple abilities one after another to traverse a single room, swapping between weapons on the fly to reveal hidden platforms and destroy blockades. It sometimes feels decidedly old school, harkening back to some of the best 2D platformers where a jumping puzzle is as engaging as a frantic battle against multiple foes. Blasphemous 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, mixing its unique and harrowing aesthetic with a gameplay amalgam of Metroidvanias and Souls-likes.","content_length":976,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"Where the first game faltered, however, its sequel makes significant improvements, resulting in a thrilling adventure that doesn't run out of steam. As you gain access to more areas of the map, you'll also begin to uncover complementary items that can be equipped to enhance The Penitent One's skillset. Prayers--which function as magical attacks--are now a viable alternative to simply cutting everything down with a melee weapon, proving much more useful in combat than they were in the first game due to an increase in damage output. You can equip two of these potent Prayers at a time, which range from short bursts of fire to sizeable beams of mystical energy. Rosary Beads also return, allowing you to increase your resistance to specific damage types. Most notable, however, is the presence of a sculptor in the game's hub area. This humble craftsman gives you access to a slew of different figures that confer powerful benefits when placed upon the altarpiece on your back.","content_length":981,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"You might find a figure that increases the stun power of your attacks, another that reduces the cooldown of your dodge, or one that improves the effect of healing items. How you align each sculpture on the altarpiece also matters, since certain figures react with one another to create additional perks. I placed two together that aligned to form another power, whereby executing an enemy would halt the passage of time for a few seconds. This proved especially useful when confronted with multiple foes, and is just one example of how these ancillary items can have a significant impact on Blasphemous 2's combat. There are a number of vendors located in the aforementioned hub area and beyond, allowing you to upgrade your health, hand over a knot to unlock another Rosary Bead, or simply purchase items. However, each one is spread out far enough--with doors, ladders, and teleportation devices in between them--that there's some notable downtime whenever you need to visit a few in succession.","content_length":997,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/","post_date":"August 17, 2023 at 10:56AM PDT","content":"This process wouldn't be quite so tedious if they were closer together. You also can't teleport between the bonfire-esque checkpoints you'll unlock across the map, instead only being able to quickly move between a few designated points, so there's a fair amount of backtracking involved that usually revolves around avoiding every enemy in your path. This is par for the course in Metroidvanias, but it feels unnecessary when the gameplay in between adds nothing of value. Even with these issues, Blasphemous 2 is an excellent sequel that improves upon its predecessor in almost all of the ways it fell short. The addition of three new weapons--and the litany of ways you can augment your build--ensure that combat is engaging throughout, while traversal has also been expanded upon in positive ways, removing much of the previous frustration by focusing on satisfying challenges and a tangible sense of progression. Combine this with another fascinating setting and deluge of haunting imagery, and this is a pilgrimage worth embarking on.","content_length":1038,"content_tokens":203,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew Review - Spectacul-arrrr","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/","date":"August 16, 2023 at 6:01AM PDT","content":"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an ideal summer movie.

You play primarily as Afia, as she revives the cursed compatriots one by one and gathers information on the hidden treasure of the Red Marley's captain, Captain Mordechai, who is conspicuously absent.

Afia is permanently seen with a spectral sword sticking out of her chest, which she draws to eliminate enemies. Suleidy looks as if she's been partially consumed by plant-life. Pinkus is a fancy lad in a powdered wig, while Quintin the treasurer carries around his own golden skull. For a game about the undead, the personalities are just crackling with life and personality. Each crew member has their own job that fits into the hierarchy of the ship to match as well. Pinkus is the quartermaster, making his foppish personality a part of how he must have greased palms when he was alive. Mr. Mercury, the shipwright, is practically a part of the ship itself with an anchor attached to his body. Afia, as the main character, is named the navigator, determining where the Red Marley goes. She is not, however, named captain--the Marley has its own agenda, and its own opinions, and its loyalty to the former captain, Mordechai, is a major driving force behind the plot. Optional Crew Tales help fill out the team's personality with self-contained stories that run the gamut from shocking to surprisingly comedic. After choosing an island and picking your team of three pirates, you choose a landing zone and begin exploring the well-guarded Inquisition encampments. Missions are focused mostly on stealth and strategy, and it's very easy to get overwhelmed if a guard spots you. Most missions have you infiltrating a particular spot by killing or distracting the guards, or eliminating a particular target. The guards have their own sets of overlapping patrol paths and sight lines, making each new area a cascading puzzle to resolve. There's a level of patience and meticulousness to carving a path through the Inquisition forces. Since it takes place mostly in real-time, you'll spend a while monitoring the guards' patrols and choosing exactly when to make your move, and how to stash the bodies of your fallen victims before other guards spot them. You'll discover the one tiny opening in their defenses and use that to take out one guard, who was providing the sightline cover for another, and then another, until an entire area lays dead. It's incredibly satisfying. That's partly because the fusions of character traits and ship roles come into even sharper focus in the missions themselves, where their powers are well differentiated. You may need to find a bush to hide a body in most circumstances, but if you've brought Suleidy along, she can simply toss a seed that immediately grows a bush anywhere you'd like. One target may be far away with tons of enemies in-between, but if you've brought Teresa the sniper, she can take them out with one well-aimed crossbow bolt. One of my favorites was Toya, the ship's cook and a Japanese pirate, who performs much faster melee executions than the rest of the crew, and who can teleport immediately to his spirit-sword for an instant-kill. Some of the powers fall into similar categories--most of the crew has some ability to distract guards or make them change positions, and the game will warn you if you try to start a mission composed only of members without such an ability. But that consideration aside, the powers and stage design are beautifully flexible, allowing you to complete a mission with essentially any combination of characters. Never once during my playthrough did I find myself unequipped to resolve a mission with the crew I had brought. I never had to start a mission over from scratch. That said, you will find yourself reloading a lot. That's because frequent save-states are a core mechanic in Shadow Gambit. The game encourages you to quickly hit a single button dedicated to creating a \"memory,\" and the Marley will even occasionally ring a bell reminding you to save if you haven't for a while. This is a game that recognizes that you'll probably get spotted or otherwise make mistakes, a lot, and it accommodates that by including save-scumming as a natural part of your progression--and even incorporating it into the story itself. Shadow Gambit does warn you if you're trying to reload a memory that's very old--which can be slightly off-putting if you pick up a suspended game on your Steam Deck after a day, because in that case, all of your saves are deemed old--but it's a helpful feature regardless. On top of their personalities and powers, each crew member is built slightly differently for traversal. Some may be more adept at swimming to flank on another side of an island, for example, while others can climb vines. It's much easier to get around and find an angle with some members, which helps balance the ones with more powerful and long-range abilities. But crucially, you can obtain your team in any order you'd like. Since their corpses are scattered around the ship, you choose which ones to revive as you obtain the needed materials. That gives the first half of the game a certain predictability, as you know you're constantly seeking sets of two magical artifacts across story missions until you've revived them all. But it also helps you build a team that truly feels like your own. For my part, I learned that looks can be deceiving, since my chosen order didn't end up aligning with my favorites. I made Pinkus one of my very first crewmates, imagining that his ability to take over the minds of enemies would prove especially valuable. In practice, Pinkus was one of my least favorite, and others that I had saved for last like Quintin became some of my go-to crew. Each member gets a short tutorial to learn their abilities after they're revived, but I may have chosen a different order if I had gotten a taste for each of them before committing to a revival. Gallery Shadow Gambit does encourage you to rotate everyone, though, as you get greater benefits from bringing along crew members who haven't been on a mission for a while. That energy can then be used to unlock a single, powerful upgrade per crew member. Afia's teleportation-kill can be upgraded to ignore altitude restrictions, for example, while Pinkus can gain the ability to take over higher-level guards. Even after dozens of hours, I haven't gotten nearly enough energy to unlock every upgrade, so this is really where it counts to pick your favorites. The stages are expertly crafted to accommodate any combination of team members, which could have run the risk of making them too samey and repetitive. In practice, though, the difficulty ramps up nicely. Later stages have truly devilish brain-teaser combinations of guards and sightlines that tested my ability to pick them off one by one. You can also pause the action and map out a plan for your crew to execute, which is especially helpful for the moments you need to pull off simultaneous kills or trigger a distraction at just the right moment. Once you've completed a stage and found your exit point, the game replays your entire run in an overhead perspective map, fast-forwarding through your chosen path and the guards you disappeared. It distills the hour or more you spent slowly navigating your way through a stage into a minute or two, encapsulating the memories of your successful and sometimes haphazard approach. Then, you get to start the next mission and do it all again. And I couldn't wait to do it all again, every time. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is, through and through, a delight. The inventive setting, swashbuckling macabre tone, an enjoyable cast of phenomenal characters, and a compelling gameplay loop all come together for a uniquely satisfying stealth-strategy experience. I can not only recommend it, but I truly hope it's the start of a franchise so that I can spend more time with me mateys.","length":10717,"tokens":2354,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew Review - Spectacul-arrrr","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/","post_date":"August 16, 2023 at 6:01AM PDT","content":"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an ideal summer movie.

For a game about the undead, the personalities are just crackling with life and personality. Each crew member has their own job that fits into the hierarchy of the ship to match as well. Pinkus is the quartermaster, making his foppish personality a part of how he must have greased palms when he was alive.

Optional Crew Tales help fill out the team's personality with self-contained stories that run the gamut from shocking to surprisingly comedic. After choosing an island and picking your team of three pirates, you choose a landing zone and begin exploring the well-guarded Inquisition encampments. Missions are focused mostly on stealth and strategy, and it's very easy to get overwhelmed if a guard spots you. Most missions have you infiltrating a particular spot by killing or distracting the guards, or eliminating a particular target. The guards have their own sets of overlapping patrol paths and sight lines, making each new area a cascading puzzle to resolve.

You'll discover the one tiny opening in their defenses and use that to take out one guard, who was providing the sightline cover for another, and then another, until an entire area lays dead. It's incredibly satisfying. That's partly because the fusions of character traits and ship roles come into even sharper focus in the missions themselves, where their powers are well differentiated. You may need to find a bush to hide a body in most circumstances, but if you've brought Suleidy along, she can simply toss a seed that immediately grows a bush anywhere you'd like. One target may be far away with tons of enemies in-between, but if you've brought Teresa the sniper, she can take them out with one well-aimed crossbow bolt.","content_length":949,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew Review - Spectacul-arrrr","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/","post_date":"August 16, 2023 at 6:01AM PDT","content":"One of my favorites was Toya, the ship's cook and a Japanese pirate, who performs much faster melee executions than the rest of the crew, and who can teleport immediately to his spirit-sword for an instant-kill. Some of the powers fall into similar categories--most of the crew has some ability to distract guards or make them change positions, and the game will warn you if you try to start a mission composed only of members without such an ability. But that consideration aside, the powers and stage design are beautifully flexible, allowing you to complete a mission with essentially any combination of characters. Never once during my playthrough did I find myself unequipped to resolve a mission with the crew I had brought. I never had to start a mission over from scratch. That said, you will find yourself reloading a lot.

This is a game that recognizes that you'll probably get spotted or otherwise make mistakes, a lot, and it accommodates that by including save-scumming as a natural part of your progression--and even incorporating it into the story itself. Shadow Gambit does warn you if you're trying to reload a memory that's very old--which can be slightly off-putting if you pick up a suspended game on your Steam Deck after a day, because in that case, all of your saves are deemed old--but it's a helpful feature regardless. On top of their personalities and powers, each crew member is built slightly differently for traversal.

But crucially, you can obtain your team in any order you'd like. Since their corpses are scattered around the ship, you choose which ones to revive as you obtain the needed materials. That gives the first half of the game a certain predictability, as you know you're constantly seeking sets of two magical artifacts across story missions until you've revived them all. But it also helps you build a team that truly feels like your own. For my part, I learned that looks can be deceiving, since my chosen order didn't end up aligning with my favorites.

Each member gets a short tutorial to learn their abilities after they're revived, but I may have chosen a different order if I had gotten a taste for each of them before committing to a revival. Gallery Shadow Gambit does encourage you to rotate everyone, though, as you get greater benefits from bringing along crew members who haven't been on a mission for a while. That energy can then be used to unlock a single, powerful upgrade per crew member. Afia's teleportation-kill can be upgraded to ignore altitude restrictions, for example, while Pinkus can gain the ability to take over higher-level guards. Even after dozens of hours, I haven't gotten nearly enough energy to unlock every upgrade, so this is really where it counts to pick your favorites.","content_length":885,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew Review - Spectacul-arrrr","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/","post_date":"August 16, 2023 at 6:01AM PDT","content":"The stages are expertly crafted to accommodate any combination of team members, which could have run the risk of making them too samey and repetitive. In practice, though, the difficulty ramps up nicely. Later stages have truly devilish brain-teaser combinations of guards and sightlines that tested my ability to pick them off one by one. You can also pause the action and map out a plan for your crew to execute, which is especially helpful for the moments you need to pull off simultaneous kills or trigger a distraction at just the right moment. Once you've completed a stage and found your exit point, the game replays your entire run in an overhead perspective map, fast-forwarding through your chosen path and the guards you disappeared. It distills the hour or more you spent slowly navigating your way through a stage into a minute or two, encapsulating the memories of your successful and sometimes haphazard approach. Then, you get to start the next mission and do it all again. And I couldn't wait to do it all again, every time. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is, through and through, a delight. The inventive setting, swashbuckling macabre tone, an enjoyable cast of phenomenal characters, and a compelling gameplay loop all come together for a uniquely satisfying stealth-strategy experience.

It's gritty like no other, unflinching in its brutality, and downright terrifying as often as it wants to be. Bringing those same qualities to a video game adaptation of the movie milestone would be paramount, which is exactly what Gun Media and Sumo Nottingham have done. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (TCM) is every bit as nauseatingly tense as the classic movie, all while cleverly gamifying its scares in ways that are satisfying and built for the long haul. Asymmetrical horror multiplayer games have been experiencing a golden age for several years now, but TCM is already my favorite of them. In TCM, a unique 4v3 setup allows each round to play out like an actual horror movie. What I didn't realize until I played it for review is that to properly balance this particular game, creating an even playing field isn't necessarily the best approach. Each round is a horror story, and its team of \"victims\" intentionally have the odds stacked against them, often coming down to just one Final Girl (or Guy) who might limp off the property to salvation. The high-stakes game of hide-and-seek is better for it. A cast of five victims and five Slaughter family members, including two newly created characters who fit right into the world, make up the roster. While those playing the family have what are essentially class-based villains to pick from, the victims are closer in performance to each other, save for a special ability they each uniquely possess and starting stats that make up their various but customizable builds. As the victims start out in the basement impaled on meat hooks, the goal is simple and exciting in horror movie terms: Get the hell out of there. That encompasses first needing to climb off the hook, then unlocking an escape route, then traversing a labyrinthine and treacherous outside section no matter which of the game's three maps they're on, all while being hunted. Needless to say, survival is never easy. Getting out of the basement is merely the first phase of your nightmare. Leatherface always starts in the basement with the victims, meaning every round begins chaotically fast, and when you hear that chainsaw revving, it's like nothing else in horror, no matter the medium. It's enough to set off someone's fight-or-flight response, and I've even played with people who voiced their wish to just die and \"get it over with\" because the terror is too much to bear. Meanwhile, two other family members start upstairs and outside, each with their own tasks to perform. Maybe the hitchhiker needs to set traps, or the cook needs to fortify exit doors with extra padlocks, or one of the new villains, Sissy, needs to poison consumables or key items. These skills play off each other well. For example, if the hitchhiker puts a trap in front of the generator, while the cook double-locks the related gate, it creates a multi-layered blockade for victims to overcome. These layers feel like walls closing in around the victims in a classic horror movie way, as undoing these stoppages takes time and sometimes makes noise. For the survivors, time is always running short, as they're slowly bleeding out for the duration of any round. They need to stay quiet, so they're not pinged for the enemies, but also move swiftly, as the longer a match goes on, usually the more things start to sway in favor of the sadistic family. That's because an immobile grandpa NPC villain can be fed blood collected from the map and from melee damage done to victims, which then allows the villains to routinely ping the entire map for survivors. This in itself becomes an exciting minigame, as victims have a few seconds' notice that the skill is about to be used, so they must stop in their tracks to stay off his figurative radar. Naturally, it's not often a good time to simply stop moving when you're trapped in a horror story, so this aspect of the game creates more signature moments where suddenly all three killers may descend on a victim who was spotted by the old man. The audio and visual elements help carry this game to greatness, as well. An original soundtrack built on an instrument the team at Gun Media calls the \"Apprehension Engine\" allows the music to adapt to every situation, culminating in a pulse-pounding number that plays whenever a player is the last victim left on the map. Every sound feels purpose-built, from the generator running in the distance, telling a player they'll need to shut it down to advance past a related gate, to the little drips in the basement that sometimes can resemble a victim rummaging for an unlock tool, or hiding in a dark corner. I also love how the teams will communicate at times, like when the cook casually chats with Sissy as the two players pass one another, or when a killer spots a victim and automatically taunts them. A visual cue also tells players when a killer is nearby, but this winds up being as scary as it is helpful, as oftentimes victims may not have known they were so close to danger. One of the best aspects of the game is the tall grass. In TCM, it's so effective that killers are liable to pass right by victims hiding in it. This is even truer on the nighttime maps. Given the victims are not really expected to survive--not all of them anyway--this is one small way of aiding the plucky kids in their escape efforts. Matches favor the killers, but crafty victims can become survivors. Though the number of maps seems low--just three, or six if you count their nighttime variants--in practice it works really well. Naturally, they each take place in the same region of Texas, so their outside sections end up feeling similar, but not without offering unique elements. In one map, for example, tall sunflower fields offer both visual variety as well as a unique escape route, giving victims more cover outdoors than other maps offer. On the slaughterhouse map, there's a portion that has felt under-patrolled by the killers, making it a good place to attempt an escape, but getting there is perhaps more difficult than other spots, as the backyard feels tighter and seems to have more locked doors than other maps. In the early hours of play, the repeated aesthetic of dry grass, dilapidated sheds, and locked gates can blend in across maps. Over time, the layouts started to piece together in my mind, which definitely helped, but I still don't feel like mentally mapping the distinct areas has tipped the scales back in my favor when playing as a victim. There's knowing the way out, and then there's performing those steps. The latter is always a struggle, as it should be. The iconic house from the movies is probably the best map, with its long driveway that feels like a terrifying sprint to freedom--provided players have shut off the generator blocking the path with an electrified trap. However, in my experience, all three maps feel well-considered in their construction, and usually a savvy player can wiggle out of an issue if they're smart, quiet, and they pick their spots to move around. My favorite environmental detail, which is found on all three maps, is how the game uses wells. When outside and feeling cornered, sometimes the safest escape is to jump down a well. It buys more time than any other method, but it leaves you hurting and also essentially resets you in the basement. This design is the lifeblood of horror as a genre, and it works so well as it's translated to a game. As soon as you hit the ground it's as though the first moments of the match are now playing out again, but usually faster. Healing will be more vital as you recover from the fall, the killers may have already eliminated allies by then, allowing them to hone in on you, and now they know exactly where you went. It's absolutely dread-inducing. I love it. All of these factors--the oppressive maps, the symbiotic skills of the killers, the necessity to be both quick and quiet, the haunting music--add up to rounds of about 10-20 minutes that feel as tense as any classically scripted single-player horror experience. It's also surprisingly rewarding. When you hear that chainsaw revving, it's like nothing else in horror, no matter the medium. TCM works really well as I've just described it. But what takes it to another level is the deep and enriching metagame, where XP is doled out both per account and per character. This means that some unlocks, like skill points, are universal. I can play well in a round as Leatherface, level up my account, then apply those skill points to a different character, even among the victims if I wish. At the same time, I'll directly improve the three equipped perks of whichever character I actually use in a round. Skill trees are lengthy, and though there are many branches displayed, and choosing one over another sometimes blocks off the one not chosen, players can respec at will and to no penalty. All skill points are returned, allowing players to rebuild their character simply and often. Further enhancing attributes of any character can also be done, such as making the aging cook a bit longer-winded so he can chase down victims better, or to make my favorite victim, the lockpicking wizard Connie, a bit tougher to kill. Whether players solidify strengths or fortify weaknesses, the number of options is surprisingly vast. Two versions of the same character may play very differently after some hours and skill points have been spent. Given how well the game delivers its scares, a rewarding metagame such as this feels like the team understood not just how to make a Texas Chain Saw Massacre game, but also how to expertly put together a multiplayer game, too.<img alt=\"Sometimes the only escape is back into the dreaded basement.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4178439-tcsm-4%281%29. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4178439-tcsm-4%281%29. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4178439-tcsm-4%281%29. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4178439-tcsm-4%281%29. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Sometimes the only escape is back into the dreaded basement. Within the realm of character customization, the only aspect that feels lacking is cosmetic choices. Each victim has several outfits that can be easily unlocked just by using them in rounds, but every option is merely a palette swap. Leatherface does enjoyably have two other outfits from the movie--the Pretty Lady and the Old Woman, but then other killers have no alternate styles at all, too. The game strives to be faithful, so I understand not wanting to let a victim unlock something immersion-breaking, but hopefully with time more varied but era-appropriate styles become available, like they did in Gun Media's previous game in this genre, Friday The 13th. In the meantime, I've taken to simply wearing whichever camouflages me the best. I have few qualms with the game as it stands today, though one that sticks out is the issue of team sizes. I routinely play with a group of three others, but because of Texas Chain Saw Massacre's 4v3 setup, that means my group will always queue into the victim side of a round, never getting to split up across teams in the same lobby. Thankfully, I find both sides very fun to play and don't have a strong preference, but if ever I am playing with my go-to group and we are itching to hunt down the victims, not play as them, it seems we can only resort to private matches. However, there's no metagame progress to be made in private matches, so it feels like there's no great solution to this, with the best option being to just accept that we'll be the victims, I suppose. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre plays, looks, and sounds like its team holds the source material in the highest regard. Faithfully transposing the film's signature terror into a modern multiplayer game is a feat on both ends. The metagame never gamifies the tension to a degree that feels distracting or dampening, and yet that rewarding gameplay loop means, despite how unnerving each round is, there's a strong pull to play it again and again. As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games.","length":12362,"tokens":2687,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a horror landmark.

This in itself becomes an exciting minigame, as victims have a few seconds' notice that the skill is about to be used, so they must stop in their tracks to stay off his figurative radar. Naturally, it's not often a good time to simply stop moving when you're trapped in a horror story, so this aspect of the game creates more signature moments where suddenly all three killers may descend on a victim who was spotted by the old man. The audio and visual elements help carry this game to greatness, as well. An original soundtrack built on an instrument the team at Gun Media calls the \"Apprehension Engine\" allows the music to adapt to every situation, culminating in a pulse-pounding number that plays whenever a player is the last victim left on the map.","content_length":961,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"Every sound feels purpose-built, from the generator running in the distance, telling a player they'll need to shut it down to advance past a related gate, to the little drips in the basement that sometimes can resemble a victim rummaging for an unlock tool, or hiding in a dark corner. I also love how the teams will communicate at times, like when the cook casually chats with Sissy as the two players pass one another, or when a killer spots a victim and automatically taunts them. A visual cue also tells players when a killer is nearby, but this winds up being as scary as it is helpful, as oftentimes victims may not have known they were so close to danger. One of the best aspects of the game is the tall grass. In TCM, it's so effective that killers are liable to pass right by victims hiding in it. This is even truer on the nighttime maps.","content_length":848,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"Given the victims are not really expected to survive--not all of them anyway--this is one small way of aiding the plucky kids in their escape efforts. Matches favor the killers, but crafty victims can become survivors. Though the number of maps seems low--just three, or six if you count their nighttime variants--in practice it works really well. Naturally, they each take place in the same region of Texas, so their outside sections end up feeling similar, but not without offering unique elements. In one map, for example, tall sunflower fields offer both visual variety as well as a unique escape route, giving victims more cover outdoors than other maps offer. On the slaughterhouse map, there's a portion that has felt under-patrolled by the killers, making it a good place to attempt an escape, but getting there is perhaps more difficult than other spots, as the backyard feels tighter and seems to have more locked doors than other maps.","content_length":946,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"In the early hours of play, the repeated aesthetic of dry grass, dilapidated sheds, and locked gates can blend in across maps. Over time, the layouts started to piece together in my mind, which definitely helped, but I still don't feel like mentally mapping the distinct areas has tipped the scales back in my favor when playing as a victim. There's knowing the way out, and then there's performing those steps. The latter is always a struggle, as it should be. The iconic house from the movies is probably the best map, with its long driveway that feels like a terrifying sprint to freedom--provided players have shut off the generator blocking the path with an electrified trap. However, in my experience, all three maps feel well-considered in their construction, and usually a savvy player can wiggle out of an issue if they're smart, quiet, and they pick their spots to move around.","content_length":887,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"My favorite environmental detail, which is found on all three maps, is how the game uses wells. When outside and feeling cornered, sometimes the safest escape is to jump down a well. It buys more time than any other method, but it leaves you hurting and also essentially resets you in the basement. This design is the lifeblood of horror as a genre, and it works so well as it's translated to a game. As soon as you hit the ground it's as though the first moments of the match are now playing out again, but usually faster. Healing will be more vital as you recover from the fall, the killers may have already eliminated allies by then, allowing them to hone in on you, and now they know exactly where you went.

It's also surprisingly rewarding. When you hear that chainsaw revving, it's like nothing else in horror, no matter the medium. TCM works really well as I've just described it. But what takes it to another level is the deep and enriching metagame, where XP is doled out both per account and per character. This means that some unlocks, like skill points, are universal. I can play well in a round as Leatherface, level up my account, then apply those skill points to a different character, even among the victims if I wish. At the same time, I'll directly improve the three equipped perks of whichever character I actually use in a round.","content_length":899,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Review - Thrill Of The Hunt","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/","post_date":"August 14, 2023 at 12:39PM PDT","content":"Skill trees are lengthy, and though there are many branches displayed, and choosing one over another sometimes blocks off the one not chosen, players can respec at will and to no penalty. All skill points are returned, allowing players to rebuild their character simply and often. Further enhancing attributes of any character can also be done, such as making the aging cook a bit longer-winded so he can chase down victims better, or to make my favorite victim, the lockpicking wizard Connie, a bit tougher to kill. Whether players solidify strengths or fortify weaknesses, the number of options is surprisingly vast.

However, there's no metagame progress to be made in private matches, so it feels like there's no great solution to this, with the best option being to just accept that we'll be the victims, I suppose. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre plays, looks, and sounds like its team holds the source material in the highest regard. Faithfully transposing the film's signature terror into a modern multiplayer game is a feat on both ends. The metagame never gamifies the tension to a degree that feels distracting or dampening, and yet that rewarding gameplay loop means, despite how unnerving each round is, there's a strong pull to play it again and again. As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games.","content_length":1019,"content_tokens":219,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"WrestleQuest Review - Not The Excellence Of Execution","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wrestlequest-review-not-the-excellence-of-execution/1900-6418100/","date":"August 7, 2023 at 4:44PM PDT","content":"Comedian and HBO host John Oliver once said \"wrestling is better than the things you like.\" The same can't always be said of wrestling games, but WrestleQuest, a new role-playing game (RPG) from Mega Cat Studios, had the potential to give truth to that statement. Unfortunately, though, WrestleQuest is marred by a litany of issues. Some are directly tied to its gameplay mechanics, while others are related to its presentation. Together they mean that what could've been a promising offering for fans of wrestling has its charm wear off in a short span of time. Your journey in WrestleQuest starts with podcast hosts regaling you of an exciting tale, one where athletes come from humble beginnings, taking on all challenges before reaching the big leagues. You're introduced to one of the main characters, the Muchacho Man Randy Santos, an obvious nod to Macho Man Randy Savage. With big goals and big dreams, Randy is joined by friends who are also seeking to prove themselves in the squared circle. Soon thereafter, you meet Brink Logan and his siblings from the cold north. Without the pink and black motif, you might not notice that Brink is a reference to Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, until he starts talking about being the \"excellence of execution,\" along with moves alluding to the Sharpshooter and a getup akin to a mob hitman. Things get chaotic from there, as you fight alongside a humanoid stag, possibly alluding to all the moose in Canada; a toy box mechanic who always wears a cap and has the \"five moves of doom\" hinted at; a soldier who's more akin to a G. I. Joe character, a fish who's also a high-flyer, dubbed as the \"Loachador\" for obvious reasons, and more. There's even a black character, The Brooter, who does a big boot, and an ability related to eating vitamins--which was a bit too on-the-nose given Hulk Hogan's past racist tirade. All in all, WrestleQuest's characters present a wacky world where athletes are joined by animal counterparts, action figures, and Transformers-esque robots. This is further exemplified by the game's use of bright and colorful visuals, with retro vibes harkening back to the days of classic RPGs. The presentation evokes SNES titles such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, with lone characters moving across the map before entering dungeons and towns. Battles, meanwhile, are turn-based affairs where you duke it out with an opposing group. These enemies range from other toys and animal creatures to bizarre contraptions. In-game, wrestling legends aren't just celebrated or idolized, they're worshipped--complete with large statues telling you of their deeds. You'll meet personages such as the aforementioned Macho Man Randy Savage, Andre the Giant, the Road Warriors, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, and more. Some would join as managers, while others could become summons. I found these facets quite endearing, not just as someone who's been eager to try more classic-themed wrestling titles, but also one who's been looking for a game that showcases what wrestling is: an over-the-top spectacle where both cartoony and serious concepts co-exist. Unfortunately, the charm and humor soon wear off as WrestleQuest's quick-time event-driven combat system reveals a lack of depth and variety. I personally have no issues with QTEs in games; if done correctly, they make for engaging and exciting moments, where you're not just watching a scene, but actively participating in one. WrestleQuest, however, forgoes moderation. Instead, it relies heavily on QTEs, almost to an egregious and exorbitant level. Every character's basic attack requires one or two perfectly timed button presses. Miss, and your character could either get countered, or their attack will deal less damage. The same can be said for many skills, which also need buttons to be pressed when prompted. Ditto for defending against certain abilities, just so you can mitigate some of the hits. This further extends to the pin system, which requires you to time your button press just as the arrow hits the green marker. For veterans of past WWE 2K titles, you'll remember this as one of the most hated mechanics during a match. In this game, however, a poorly timed click also causes a downed wrestler opponent to get healed partially and get back on their feet. Naturally, you'd get attacked soon thereafter, causing a tiresome back and forth. You're more likely to enable the auto-pin setting because of this. There's also another option that allows you to deal maximum damage, though this makes the game too easy to a fault. Another recently added option slows down QTEs, though that doesn’t change the fact that many combat actions still require them. Since QTEs are a core gameplay mechanic, it’s as though your only option is to continue playing even when it becomes tedious, or to remove the challenge entirely, with nothing in between. Combat also includes the hype system, where certain actions boost or lower hype, providing boosts to your three-person party depending on the thresholds that you reach. There are also managers that add passive boons, as well as tag team and triple team maneuvers. Sadly, all of these take a backseat to questionable mechanics that, rather than creating a deep and dynamic system, becomes an overused and repetitive gimmick instead. Turn-based combat is often more engaging when it entails deep, tactical options, as opposed to depending on numerous timed button presses for multiple actions. Another one of WrestleQuest's flaws is its pacing: it jumps from one team to the next, almost without rhyme or reason. You can guess that the presentation might be akin to a movie or a show: we see the heroes come from different backgrounds; we see how all have separate adventures; and, finally, the whole gang is united. The concept works on paper, but is deeply flawed once you play for a few hours. There were instances when certain ideas were introduced, such as fixing cars, only for that mechanic to be of no use when it abruptly switches to a party that’s in another area. There were moments when I was in the middle of a quest and I'd reach an objective, but then the game jumps to another character's perspective, and that person is tackling a different quest. Likewise, there were parts where a new teammate joins the crew, only to immediately return to the previous squad's section, without so much as being able to see that teammate’s capabilities. Ordinarily, an RPG gives players a quest objective, which they finish before moving to the next one. Along the way the player encounters different characters, a boss, a new biome, or is taken on a narrative arc that has time to breathe so players can immerse themselves. WrestleQuest upends this format for something much more chaotic and incohesive, as though it's simply trying to tick the boxes for various ideas, tropes, and environments with no rhyme or reason. At one point, you're exploring a sci-fi-themed location, but then another squad is in the desert, which then shifts to a third group in a graveyard, only for that group's quest to remain incomplete since you'd return to your squad in the sci-fi area. Lather, rinse, and repeat for over a dozen hours. This kind of contrasting shifts could be utilized to interesting effect if there was some narrative conceit or some other gameplay or aesthetic idea causing it--Chrono Trigger, for example, takes players through vastly different environments quickly, but it's all driven by a time-traveling and reality-hopping story. WrestleQuest doesn't have anything like that, it just feels random. Gallery For the sake of transparency, there were technical issues that I experienced during the course of our WrestleQuest review. There's a possibility that you won't encounter these at launch, but they're worth noting, nonetheless. The biggest was a bug in a location where my team had to split up to interact with three gates. Getting discovered by a spotlight caused a character to get teleported to the middle path, with no way of returning to the other areas. Since the game only autosaves the latest save state, that meant loading a manual save instead. And, as you may have guessed, my last manual save was several hours prior, which meant I had to redo entire sections. WrestleQuest has the right tools to make for a memorable wrestling RPG experience, with its quirky characters, vibrant atmosphere, and countless references. Unfortunately, though, its over-reliance on a rote combat system, poorly paced narrative, and issues under the hood make for a frustrating experience. Far from being Mr. Perfect, it is, instead, the Genesis of McGillicutty.","length":8649,"tokens":1818,"chunks":[{"post_title":"WrestleQuest Review - Not The Excellence Of Execution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wrestlequest-review-not-the-excellence-of-execution/1900-6418100/","post_date":"August 7, 2023 at 4:44PM PDT","content":"Comedian and HBO host John Oliver once said \"wrestling is better than the things you like.\" The same can't always be said of wrestling games, but WrestleQuest, a new role-playing game (RPG) from Mega Cat Studios, had the potential to give truth to that statement.

There's a possibility that you won't encounter these at launch, but they're worth noting, nonetheless. The biggest was a bug in a location where my team had to split up to interact with three gates. Getting discovered by a spotlight caused a character to get teleported to the middle path, with no way of returning to the other areas. Since the game only autosaves the latest save state, that meant loading a manual save instead.","content_length":996,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WrestleQuest Review - Not The Excellence Of Execution","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wrestlequest-review-not-the-excellence-of-execution/1900-6418100/","post_date":"August 7, 2023 at 4:44PM PDT","content":"And, as you may have guessed, my last manual save was several hours prior, which meant I had to redo entire sections.

Those games feel like I have a hand in shaping the outcome of the story, one in which successfully navigating a tricky conversation is empowering and not quite finding the words for a tough heart-to-heart is devastating. Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical builds on that sensation but within the three-act structure of a musical. This combination is an impressive accomplishment, and it's incredible to watch how all those choices can build on one another, culminating in a finale that you helped shape. Together, it makes Stray Gods one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've ever had. Set within our world--but one in which there's an ounce of truth to the myths surrounding the Greek gods, titans, and their multitude of offspring--Stray Gods starts off like your typical visual novel. Conversations pause in order to present you with a multitude of dialogue options, some of which allow you to gain additional insight into other characters while others push the story forward to the next scene. Almost immediately, you have a chance to flirt with your cute best friend and kickstart one of several different romances. There's comfort in this familiarity. And then the game quickly reveals what separates itself from its contemporaries: the music. You can adjust the settings to remove the time limit when it comes to selecting choices during songs. You actively participate in every musical number during Stray Gods runtime, of which there are many across its three acts. Like conversations in choice-driven visual novels and RPGs, each song can branch, and the effects of your choices impact not only the direction of that particular song but every performance that succeeds it. Choices are divided into three categories--Kickass, Clever, and Charming--informing both the method by which you're trying to convince someone of something, and how a song can transform. Kickass choices are aggressive and confrontational and make songs take on a more punk rock vibe, while Clever choices are thoughtful and strategic and lean into jazz. Charming choices, on the other hand, are empathetic and caring and create a more melodious tune. Though all of the songs might begin one way, they can drastically change depending on what you choose. As far as I can tell--there are a lot of choices to make in this game and I only replayed each song so many times before moving on--every direction a song can take flows together. I cannot fathom how difficult a task that is to pull off (we're talking different genres and tempos yet it still has to all feel like the same song) but it's all tightly woven together into this beautiful symphony of sound that leans into the transformative qualities of music to explore everything from fated heartbreak to lingering trauma. It also helps that this formula works wonders narratively, as the game sees you take on the role of the last Muse within the Greek pantheon as she explores the healing powers of music. In Stray Gods, you play as Grace, a normal human thrust into a death sentence when the leadership of the existing Greek pantheon--Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Persephone--mistakenly condemns her for the murder of Calliope. Grace was the only one present during the final moments of the Muse's life as she bleeds out from a stab wound, leading to the false accusation. Grace is allowed a week to prove her innocence, seeking answers and chasing down leads with the help of her best friend Freddie. Grace will have to prove herself to Persephone, Apollo, Athena, and Aphrodite to escape death. Within the world of Stray Gods, the members of the Greek pantheon pass their souls, or eidolons, to the nearest person to them when they die, and so Grace inherits Calliope's abilities and becomes a Muse, giving her the power to help anyone reveal their true feelings or fully express themselves through song. She also inherits Calliope's family as well, putting her in the orbit of Hermes, Pan, Eros, and other entities of myth, many of whom have their own motivations for wanting to help Grace track down Calliope's killer. It's a fantastic story with a rewarding sense of agency in how you approach conversations and your overall investigation. Very early into the game, I started to think that I wasn't going to solve the case or that I might even take the fall for who I suspected to be the real killer because I didn't want them to die. So I figured my best chance at survival was accruing allies and being nice to the most powerful members of the pantheon so when the week ended and Grace's trial rolled around, I'd have people to stand by my side and say I shouldn't die anyway even if I was guilty. As more was uncovered and I stumbled into increasingly troubling revelations, I realized I likely wasn't jetting toward either conclusion I initially thought I was. But my decision to gather as many allies as possible still came in clutch by helping me circumnavigate several issues in the late game. There were a lot of people who felt indebted to me, and they allowed me to go to places and talk to people I shouldn't have as well as stood up for me in moments where events could have gone south very quickly. My choices were honored. The Greek pantheon--now calling themselves the Idols--is a messy bunch, struggling to survive hundreds of miles away from home in America with many of their number (including the big three of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades) gone, either because they walked away from the Idols or because they died with no one nearby to absorb their eidolon. Grace, approaching them with the fresh perspective of someone who has only recently become a god, is able to help them tackle their issues with the more fervent immediacy of a mortal, wielding the power of music to help these gods delve into whatever problem has been ailing them for decades, sometimes centuries.<img alt=\"How Grace talks to and about people can influence her relationship with them.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4173871-choices. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4173871-choices. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4173871-choices. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4173871-choices. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">How Grace talks to and about people can influence her relationship with them. But music is such an interpretative power. When Grace invites someone to sing with her, you're usually not being told how someone feels. And so each song becomes this balancing act of people, using music, rhyme schemes, and playful wordplay to try and reach a place of emotional understanding and catharsis. It transforms what otherwise might have been simple conversations into intense battles of emotion, each side bouncing off one another with carefully crafted improvisation. And just as these musical numbers can be funny and joyous at times, they can also be absolutely heartbreaking. However, they're always memorable and culminate in a musical finale that is built from all the music and emotional connections that you managed to create. Many of the scenes in Stray Gods are going to sit with me for a long time, especially the ones where it seemed like there was no real right answer to the difficult morally gray questions being asked, resigning me to guide Grace as best I could and hope for the best. It occasionally worked, but it just as often didn't. Regardless of how I pushed Grace to act, the results always had an impact on what happened in the song next and how the outcome of the interaction ultimately influenced the direction of the story. That said, it's not just your vocal performances that determine your fate. Between performances, you'll be tasked with chasing down clues behind Calliope's murder, deciding who to talk to and in what order, and investigating crime scenes. The moment-to-moment gameplay of crime scene investigations is a tad too simplistic to produce a rewarding problem-solving experience, which is my one major gripe with the game. When Grace is investigating a space, you're given a list of items to look at and you just keep clicking through until you arrive at the clue Grace is looking for. Thankfully, these moments are few and far between. The rest of the game is conversing with characters, and gathering clues depending on who you choose to talk to and what information you trust to share with them. Sometimes Grace needs to lie or hold back on sharing information to preserve a relationship and learn something important, and other times being aggressive or truthful or charming is the way to go. There's actual strategy and consequence to your investigation when it comes to talking to people--the main crux of the game--and that fulfills the fantasy of being a musically-inclined crack detective. Early in the game, you get to choose whether Grace is an especially Kickass, Clever, or Charming person, and this opens up unique dialogue options that further shape how individual relationships play out. It's easier to prove your worth to the in-your-face disgraced Queen of the Underworld Persephone if Grace has access to Kickass options, for example, while a Clever Grace can go toe-to-toe with the secretive goddess of wisdom Athena or the mischievous god of chaos Pan. These dialogue options don't seem to have as impactful an effect on the story as a whole, but they do inject some welcome replayability into Stray Gods if--like me--you want to see all the different ways that each song can play out and you want how Grace interacts with people to be slightly different playthrough to playthrough.<img alt=\"Grace can be likable and charming, confrontational and kickass, or witty and clever.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4173870-straygodstraits. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4173870-straygodstraits. jpg 2560w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4173870-straygodstraits. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4173870-straygodstraits. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Grace can be likable and charming, confrontational and kickass, or witty and clever. Stray Gods is also just a pleasant game to look at and listen to. Emulating a comic book look and art style, it incorporates a lot of movement in its scenes, quickly shifting the position and stance of different characters and objects to add a frenetic pull from shot to shot. It helps guide your eyes across the screen, creating a sense of action with what is essentially a lot of still images. This further personalizes certain characters, lending narrative weight to how they move and act. Apollo plods through scenes with a tired discomfort, for example, while Medusa almost seems to slither with her more rhythmic and weave-like movements. But more importantly, it adds to the spectacle of each musical performance, drawing inspiration from the likes of Broadway or K-Pop music videos to create a beautiful animatic-style cinematic experience. Every musical number is a spectacle that further reinforces the importance of each choice you make but also helps you understand the vibe that you and the other singer are creating based on what choices you're making. It certainly helps that Stray Gods has an incredible vocal cast, many of whom can draw you into the next musical performance within a few notes. The most notable standout is Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part II's Abbey and Marvel's Spider-Man's Mary Jane), who absolutely dazzles as Grace, weaving back-and-forth between musical genres and giving the protagonist a lovable spunk. But there are plenty of other fun surprises as well. Anjali Bhimani (Overwatch's Symmetra and Apex Legends' Rampart) is phenomenal, absolutely killing it as Medusa during my favorite musical number of the entire game. And both Rahul Kohli (Midnight Mass' Sheriff Hassan and Harley Quinn's Scarecrow) and Allegra Clark (Apex Legends' Bloodhound and Dragon Age Inquisition's Josephine Montilyet) bring adorable energy to the monstrous Asterius and Hecate, respectively. I could go on, but the point is that the pool of actors for this game is a talented one, and each imbues their own character with energy that's simultaneously recognizable and yet brand-new. And there's an intriguing element to that divide. For instance, Bhimani hisses with monstrous glee when it comes to Medusa, but there's an underlying sense of self-hatred and fear as well. The first part--the monster--matches the common preconception of Medusa but the latter does not. As you meet more and more characters, you'll see how all the actors use their musical performances to nudge certain questions into your brain, convincing you to go uncover what has changed about these well-known mythical figures. And the desire to tug on those threads and unveil more of this world compels you forward with earnest curiosity, having the likely intended effect of drawing you further into the overarching mystery of both who killed Calliope and why. As you better understand who these people were and what they are now, the answer to those questions becomes ever more compelling to pursue. Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical is one of the coolest games I've played in a while and I imagine its most powerful moments will sit with me for quite a bit. Having seen cluttered whiteboards that provide a glimpse of the massive branching storylines in some RPGs and visual novels, doing something like that but for songs--a means of communication that does not follow the conventions of conversations at all--is incredibly impressive. But the folks over at Summerfall Studios managed to pull it off, creating a game that explores the extraordinary healing power that music can have in our lives and wrapping it all up in a compelling murder mystery where the consequences of your choices can have drastic effects on a weakening Greek pantheon just trying to survive in the modern day. This is a fantastic visual novel and I cannot wait to play through it again.","length":14371,"tokens":3107,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical Review - Worthy Of An Encore","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/","post_date":"August 9, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"I've played plenty of video games over the years that have both rewarded and punished me for the choices I've made, creating this powerful sense of agency in the narrative.

But more importantly, it adds to the spectacle of each musical performance, drawing inspiration from the likes of Broadway or K-Pop music videos to create a beautiful animatic-style cinematic experience.","content_length":848,"content_tokens":169,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical Review - Worthy Of An Encore","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/","post_date":"August 9, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"Every musical number is a spectacle that further reinforces the importance of each choice you make but also helps you understand the vibe that you and the other singer are creating based on what choices you're making. It certainly helps that Stray Gods has an incredible vocal cast, many of whom can draw you into the next musical performance within a few notes. The most notable standout is Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part II's Abbey and Marvel's Spider-Man's Mary Jane), who absolutely dazzles as Grace, weaving back-and-forth between musical genres and giving the protagonist a lovable spunk. But there are plenty of other fun surprises as well. Anjali Bhimani (Overwatch's Symmetra and Apex Legends' Rampart) is phenomenal, absolutely killing it as Medusa during my favorite musical number of the entire game.","content_length":815,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical Review - Worthy Of An Encore","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/","post_date":"August 9, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"And both Rahul Kohli (Midnight Mass' Sheriff Hassan and Harley Quinn's Scarecrow) and Allegra Clark (Apex Legends' Bloodhound and Dragon Age Inquisition's Josephine Montilyet) bring adorable energy to the monstrous Asterius and Hecate, respectively. I could go on, but the point is that the pool of actors for this game is a talented one, and each imbues their own character with energy that's simultaneously recognizable and yet brand-new. And there's an intriguing element to that divide. For instance, Bhimani hisses with monstrous glee when it comes to Medusa, but there's an underlying sense of self-hatred and fear as well. The first part--the monster--matches the common preconception of Medusa but the latter does not.","content_length":726,"content_tokens":164,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical Review - Worthy Of An Encore","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/","post_date":"August 9, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"As you meet more and more characters, you'll see how all the actors use their musical performances to nudge certain questions into your brain, convincing you to go uncover what has changed about these well-known mythical figures. And the desire to tug on those threads and unveil more of this world compels you forward with earnest curiosity, having the likely intended effect of drawing you further into the overarching mystery of both who killed Calliope and why. As you better understand who these people were and what they are now, the answer to those questions becomes ever more compelling to pursue. Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical is one of the coolest games I've played in a while and I imagine its most powerful moments will sit with me for quite a bit. Having seen cluttered whiteboards that provide a glimpse of the massive branching storylines in some RPGs and visual novels, doing something like that but for songs--a means of communication that does not follow the conventions of conversations at all--is incredibly impressive. But the folks over at Summerfall Studios managed to pull it off, creating a game that explores the extraordinary healing power that music can have in our lives and wrapping it all up in a compelling murder mystery where the consequences of your choices can have drastic effects on a weakening Greek pantheon just trying to survive in the modern day. This is a fantastic visual novel and I cannot wait to play through it again.","content_length":1469,"content_tokens":281,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"[Editor's note: This review encompasses episodes one, two, and three of The Expanse: A Telltale Series]Within minutes of firing up the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, you'll be faced with a series of life-or-death choices. Though some choices may seem trivial at first, nearly all of them result in \"[character name] will remember that\" appearing in the top-left corner of the screen, leaving you to wonder what exactly will happen if that choice comes back to bite you a few episodes later. These kinds of narrative choices and consequences are a staple of the Telltale brand and, at first glance, one might mistake The Expanse for a clone of the studio's previous games, reskinned to reflect the appropriate franchise--but this couldn't be further from the truth. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that Deck Nine Games--the studio that developed Life Is Strange: True Colors and is Telltale's co-developer for this project--has quite literally added a new dimension to the standard Telltale formula. In The Expanse, players can freely explore the three-dimensional game environment, a first for Telltale, as the studio's previous games provided very little opportunity for exploration and freedom of movement. This change to a standard third-person perspective works wonders for immersion, especially given the game's large, detailed environments. The ability to hear Camina Drummer's inner monologue--something never seen on the show--also plays a huge part in bringing the game to life, creating a sense of connection between the player and the game's protagonist. In the television show, Drummer is known to be rather reclusive, rarely sharing her feelings aloud. The decision to let us hear her inner thoughts is a bold choice, but it works incredibly well due to the game's stellar writing and the performance of Drummer's voice actress. Cara Gee (who plays Drummer in The Expanse television series) reprises her role once again and Gee's powerful, emotive performance makes all the difference--it's hard to imagine the game without her. Unlike the television show, Telltale's The Expanse allows us to see a new, slightly more vulnerable side of the normally reserved, enigmatic Belter by serving as a prequel that details what Drummer's life was like leading up to the events of the television show. Interacting with objects will prompt Drummer to audibly share her thoughts on the matter at hand, and this mechanic is an excellent way to introduce Drummer to players who may not be familiar with the show. Of course, the game also includes a group of new characters, all of whom serve aboard the scavenger ship Artemis alongside Drummer. From the gruff, elderly pilot, Khan, to the contrasting personalities of the Morozov twins, Arlen and Rayen, Telltale's characters feel genuine, like they could just as easily fit into The Expanse television show or the book series upon which it is based. Your opinion of each character will change wildly as the narrative unfolds, but it always feels like these characters are each growing in a specific direction, not constantly wavering back and forth between trustworthy ally and loose cannon with a hair-trigger. It's a sharp contrast to the supporting characters of previous Telltale games, like Kenny from The Walking Dead series, who frequently bounced between \"helpful companion\" and \"selfish idiot who randomly turns on me when the plot decides it needs a twist.\"Since Telltale's The Expanse is a prequel to the television series, Drummer's plot-armor is thicker than the hull of the Artemis, but her fellow crew members aren't as lucky. At the end of the fifth and final episode, players can find themselves with no crew members left alive except Drummer, or with the entire squad saved, depending on the choices Drummer makes. Despite being only five episodes long (with a sixth DLC episode set to release this fall), the game's characters are intriguing and believable enough for players to quickly form attachments, making it all the more devastating when you fail to save one of them. Aside from the ability to freely roam and explore, the most notable difference between The Expanse and Telltale's previous projects is the higher-quality animation. Deck Nine's commitment to striking visuals is immediately apparent within the first few minutes of the game. Instead of the cartoonish, stylized character designs of Telltale's previous games, The Expanse boasts more realistic graphics and cutscenes that don't constantly cut to a close-up shot to hide wonky animations--mainly because there weren't any wonky animations in need of hiding in my time with it. Cutscenes are extremely detailed but even outside of cutscenes, the game's interior environments feel lived-in and alive, while exteriors set in the vacuum of space feel appropriately enormous for a franchise called The Expanse. The game's biggest visual triumph is undoubtedly the characters' facial motion-capture and animations. Previous Telltale games often struggled with facial expressions, leaving characters looking stiff and strange. But Deck Nine's animations are smooth and realistic, with characters often sharing knowing looks that make you wonder what they're thinking, or having brief exchanges with Drummer that consist solely of body language and facial expressions. The positive effect of these moments cannot be overstated--every frame of every cutscene is executed with purpose, and between the characters' lovable (and sometimes love-to-hateable) personalities and the developer's determination to create cinematic cutscenes, it often feels like you're directing an episode of the television show, not just playing a game. But one of the game's strongest features is that, above all, it achieves its goal through a story that is strong enough to stand on its own. Some cutscenes have awkward gaps and pauses between lines, but it's a rare occurrence, and you'll never meet an NPC who spends a solid three minutes word-vomiting exposition at you before sending you on a fetch quest, which is a major plus. When it comes to both dialogue and actions, Drummer is almost always faced with only two options, but surprisingly, those options never feel like binary \"good\" and \"bad\" choices. Drummer isn't simply good or bad, a renegade or a paragon--she's just Drummer, a woman who has had to make incredibly difficult decisions all her life. It's rare that you'll come across a choice where one option immediately feels like it's the obvious \"right\" choice, unless you've found environmental context clues that point you in (what appears to be) the right direction.[Cutscenes are] executed with purpose, and between the characters' lovable (and sometimes love-to-hateable) personalities and the developer's determination to create cinematic cutscenes, it often feels like you're directing an episode of the television show, not just playing a game. Despite the game's narrative arc hinging on various dialogue choices, The Expanse strongly adheres to a \"show, don't tell\" policy, using environmental storytelling in a way that makes the game's levels fun to explore even when there's no loot to be had. It's always worth taking a look around, especially when on board the Artemis. In fact, the Artemis is where you should do the most looking around, as objects Drummer can inspect often reveal helpful clues that make difficult decisions much easier. If Drummer notices a defaced poster on the wall, the next time you inspect it, there may be more graffiti added to it. If she comments on an unsecured item in a crew member's quarters and returns later, it will likely be lying on the floor in several pieces due to getting knocked around in zero-g. Unfortunately, zero-g movement is the game's biggest flaw. It looks gorgeous and realistic from a visual perspective, but in practice, using Drummer's vac-suit thrusters sends you floating across the infinite expanse of space at roughly the same speed as an exhausted tortoise. The suit has two speeds: slow, and slightly less-slow. When you're hunting down an item for a side quest in a massive ship graveyard, the realization that you need to backtrack is likely to be accompanied by a frustrated groan due to the amount of time it will take to retrace your steps. If you drift too far into space, a notification appears, informing you that you're leaving the safe zone. This, combined with the dark and often disorienting locations Drummer must explore early on in the game can make some levels more frustrating than they need to be. Another weak spot is the collectible mechanic. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to collect various valuables scavenged from derelict ships. Drummer often comments on what the item is, and which NPC crew member might find it useful. But there's no inventory for these items to be seen in, no opportunity to give them to anyone, and it's very difficult to tell if they're just there to give completionists something to do, or if they actually affect the plot. The main collectibles you'll need to worry about are made very obvious--they appear as side quests in the game's mission log, and are separated from the scavenged loot. The biggest problem here is that each level has a point of no return at the end, but it's never clear what exactly will trigger it. In Chapter 2, for instance, the main quest tasks you with finding three fuel sources, and also gives you two side quests with additional items that are important to specific characters. But if you complete the main quest before locating the side quest items, you'll immediately be thrown into a cutscene and will not be able to return and continue your search unless you restart the episode. A simple prompt asking you if you're ready to leave once you've completed a main quest (which often consists of several stages, making it even harder to discern how close you are to finishing it) would instantly solve this problem. Still, the game shines in just about every other category. One particularly impressive feat the developers somehow managed to pull off was making Drummer's words and actions believable, no matter which choices you make while playing as her. Whether it's amputating an innocent man's leg in the middle of a spacewalk or deciding to \"space\" a troublemaker (read: toss them out of an open airlock with no vac-suit), Drummer executes whatever option you choose in a manner that doesn't seem out of character for her, even when the options presented are polar opposites. Though Drummer's dialogue response options are usually limited to only two choices, these options almost always work flawlessly when it comes to authenticity. The dialogue choice descriptions are short, but The Expanse avoids forcing the player to choose a line of dialogue based on a misleading description--Drummer doesn't blurt out something entirely unexpected in a tone you didn't intend for her to use. You won't find yourself thinking, \"I didn't mean for her to say it like that,\" an issue often seen when RPG dialogue options are too short or too vague. The game's writing is, without question, its greatest strength. You'll laugh out loud at everything from snappy comebacks to humorously penned datapad entries. But just like the television show and book series, the game's sense of humor thankfully does not suffer from a Marvel-esque need to throw in a self-conscious joke every time there's a moment of tension, instead managing to stay perfectly balanced in the \"Goldilocks zone\" when it comes to comic relief. Moments of levity are there when appropriate, but intense scenes are given time to breathe--as are tender moments between Drummer and her love interest. The chemistry between Drummer and Martian ship mechanic Maya Castillo is palpable from the moment they meet. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether Drummer will pursue her romantically, and given the fact that Maya's the only romanceable NPC in the game, pursuing her seems like a forgone conclusion. In most RPGs, romance and survival aren't inherently tied together. In The Expanse, romance is a moral conundrum from the moment it presents itself. The Artemis is a small ship--people are bound to find out, and crew members will often allude to the idea that one person or another is being shown favoritism even before you have the opportunity to pursue Maya. Other realistic dilemmas also result from this potential romance. If you don't respond to Maya's romantic overtures, will the offer be gone for good, or will Drummer get another chance to make a move? The game gives itself room to evoke these questions of morality and logistics by focusing on a single relationship. One would think that Maya's presence alone means it's meant to be. Perhaps it is, but the game's atmosphere constantly communicates reminders that every move Drummer makes has a butterfly effect on the rest of the game. The biggest romantic dilemma most RPG protagonists typically face is choosing which NPC to woo. But The Expanse forces you to answer better, more interesting questions. Not just, \"Am I interested in her?\" but \"Is this a good idea right now? Is it a good idea at all?\"Telltale's Expanse is a masterclass in narrative design, and subsequent playthroughs will reveal that, unlike some of the studio's previous offerings, almost every single choice the player makes does have a unique outcome. The Expanse doesn't present you with the illusion of choice, where you're constantly making decisions, but only a few of them actually matter. It cleverly utilizes environmental clues, subtle facial animations, and other non-verbal hints to allow you to find answers to your questions, rather than spoon-feeding you expositional dialogue. Whether your goal is learning more about Virgil, the ship's secretive medic, or simply figuring out who stole Khan's BBQ sauce, Telltale's Expanse leaves no stone unturned, and no loose end untied. Gallery More than that, The Expanse has what I've been searching for in Telltale games since The Walking Dead Season 1: soul. Characters don't feel disposable, death doesn't feel inevitable, and happiness doesn't seem as hopelessly out-of-reach as it does in Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, which makes for a refreshing change. The Expanse is not populated with throwaway characters who already feel doomed to be a victim for the sake of drama, or soulless zombies who can be killed without a second thought. If you fire a weapon in The Expanse, you are changing the life of a real human being, and the game makes sure you know it. Because every NPC companion can be saved, being unable to save one of them (or having to make the painful choice not to) hits hard, even if that character poses a significant risk to Drummer or the rest of the crew. In a world of enormous RPGs with seemingly endless side quests and huge maps, The Expanse: A Telltale Series is a refreshing change of pace, and proves that sometimes, less is more. A great RPG doesn't necessarily need to be a 60-hour adventure; it just needs to convincingly drop you into another person's magboots. The Expanse does that and then some, forcing you to make difficult decisions that will haunt you long after you've finished playing.","length":15224,"tokens":3144,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"[Editor's note: This review encompasses episodes one, two, and three of The Expanse: A Telltale Series]Within minutes of firing up the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, you'll be faced with a series of life-or-death choices.

One particularly impressive feat the developers somehow managed to pull off was making Drummer's words and actions believable, no matter which choices you make while playing as her.","content_length":678,"content_tokens":130,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"Whether it's amputating an innocent man's leg in the middle of a spacewalk or deciding to \"space\" a troublemaker (read: toss them out of an open airlock with no vac-suit), Drummer executes whatever option you choose in a manner that doesn't seem out of character for her, even when the options presented are polar opposites. Though Drummer's dialogue response options are usually limited to only two choices, these options almost always work flawlessly when it comes to authenticity. The dialogue choice descriptions are short, but The Expanse avoids forcing the player to choose a line of dialogue based on a misleading description--Drummer doesn't blurt out something entirely unexpected in a tone you didn't intend for her to use. You won't find yourself thinking, \"I didn't mean for her to say it like that,\" an issue often seen when RPG dialogue options are too short or too vague. The game's writing is, without question, its greatest strength.","content_length":950,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"You'll laugh out loud at everything from snappy comebacks to humorously penned datapad entries. But just like the television show and book series, the game's sense of humor thankfully does not suffer from a Marvel-esque need to throw in a self-conscious joke every time there's a moment of tension, instead managing to stay perfectly balanced in the \"Goldilocks zone\" when it comes to comic relief. Moments of levity are there when appropriate, but intense scenes are given time to breathe--as are tender moments between Drummer and her love interest. The chemistry between Drummer and Martian ship mechanic Maya Castillo is palpable from the moment they meet. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether Drummer will pursue her romantically, and given the fact that Maya's the only romanceable NPC in the game, pursuing her seems like a forgone conclusion. In most RPGs, romance and survival aren't inherently tied together.","content_length":926,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"In The Expanse, romance is a moral conundrum from the moment it presents itself. The Artemis is a small ship--people are bound to find out, and crew members will often allude to the idea that one person or another is being shown favoritism even before you have the opportunity to pursue Maya. Other realistic dilemmas also result from this potential romance. If you don't respond to Maya's romantic overtures, will the offer be gone for good, or will Drummer get another chance to make a move? The game gives itself room to evoke these questions of morality and logistics by focusing on a single relationship. One would think that Maya's presence alone means it's meant to be. Perhaps it is, but the game's atmosphere constantly communicates reminders that every move Drummer makes has a butterfly effect on the rest of the game. The biggest romantic dilemma most RPG protagonists typically face is choosing which NPC to woo. But The Expanse forces you to answer better, more interesting questions.","content_length":998,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"Not just, \"Am I interested in her?\" but \"Is this a good idea right now?

The Expanse doesn't present you with the illusion of choice, where you're constantly making decisions, but only a few of them actually matter. It cleverly utilizes environmental clues, subtle facial animations, and other non-verbal hints to allow you to find answers to your questions, rather than spoon-feeding you expositional dialogue. Whether your goal is learning more about Virgil, the ship's secretive medic, or simply figuring out who stole Khan's BBQ sauce, Telltale's Expanse leaves no stone unturned, and no loose end untied.","content_length":857,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review – Choices That Matter","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 12:45PM PDT","content":"Gallery More than that, The Expanse has what I've been searching for in Telltale games since The Walking Dead Season 1: soul. Characters don't feel disposable, death doesn't feel inevitable, and happiness doesn't seem as hopelessly out-of-reach as it does in Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, which makes for a refreshing change. The Expanse is not populated with throwaway characters who already feel doomed to be a victim for the sake of drama, or soulless zombies who can be killed without a second thought. If you fire a weapon in The Expanse, you are changing the life of a real human being, and the game makes sure you know it. Because every NPC companion can be saved, being unable to save one of them (or having to make the painful choice not to) hits hard, even if that character poses a significant risk to Drummer or the rest of the crew. In a world of enormous RPGs with seemingly endless side quests and huge maps, The Expanse: A Telltale Series is a refreshing change of pace, and proves that sometimes, less is more. A great RPG doesn't necessarily need to be a 60-hour adventure; it just needs to convincingly drop you into another person's magboots. The Expanse does that and then some, forcing you to make difficult decisions that will haunt you long after you've finished playing.","content_length":1301,"content_tokens":283,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Exoprimal Review - Prehistoric Warfare","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/exoprimal-review-prehistoric-warfare/1900-6418097/","date":"August 1, 2023 at 9:49AM PDT","content":"Multiplayer games can live or die based on first impressions, with many games putting their best foot forward by immediately showing off the variety of content they have. Exoprimal takes the opposite approach, only sharing a slice of what it has to offer for the first few hours of gameplay, risking people bouncing off due to a lack of content. It holds back its best moments and more interesting missions for anyone willing to put in the work. Intense and exciting surprises await those who put in the time to reach them--something that it's well worth doing. Exoprimal is a 5v5 shooter, except that the majority of your time will be spent shooting hordes of AI-controlled dinosaurs and not the enemy team. Players race to complete a series of objectives, culminating in a final one that sometimes has PvP elements. Most missions follow this structure, with a few special missions taking place later in the story that deviate from this formula. The gameplay itself is primarily about fighting off hordes of dinosaurs, utilizing your suits specific loadout. The different Exosuits can drastically change the feel of combat, with damage focused suits utilizing a regular machine gun, grenade launcher, or melee weapons. The tank and healer classes each have their own weapons and feel, but with the addition of either a shield ability or healing ability. But the difference between Exosuits, like the counter-focused tank Murasame and the machine gun wielding Krieger tank, is more than enough to make each suit feel fresh in combat. All this brings a nice variety to gameplay, with the shooting itself feeling solid and the different enemies and weak points rewarding accurate shooting. While it's a multiplayer-only game, Exoprimal has a story, but it implants this differently than most, with cutscenes tied to completing matches and special story-based missions appearing at certain milestones. The tone is similar to a low-budget sci-fi movie, with all of the main characters talking and acting like it's an '80s action film, with eye-rolling one-liners and unearned bravado. While the story and dialogue is extremely cheesy, it does mostly work in the context of its ridiculous story. The story is doled out in a series of cutscenes that unlock by finishing a certain number of multiplayer matches and small codex entries that are awarded at the end of each match. The story of Exoprimal is overly complicated, with time travel and different dimensions drowning out the ongoing problem of dinosaur storms. It does a great job of not boring you with the details, saving that for the codex system, which contains smaller bits of information that you can engage with if you want to. Instead, the main cutscenes deal directly with the drama of your team seeing future and alternate versions of themselves, as well as the main conflict against the AI named Leviathan. It won't emotionally move you, but it's good enough that you probably won't skip the cutscenes when they do pop up. The convoluted story of a rogue AI forcing Exofighters from across different dimensions and timelines to fight simulated waves of dinosaurs in order to build the perfect exosuit isn't super compelling, but the way it impacts the actual missions is. The first example of this is when Magnum, an NPC Exofighter, goes rogue to enter one of your multiplayer instances to collect data on Leviathan, prompting the AI to get angry. Leviathan ups the difficulty, literally, spawning in the first appearance of a massive raptor storm. In previous missions, you would be tasked with taking down a few hundred raptors in a single instance, but this time you need to take down over 1,000 to clear the mission. This difficulty spike came as a welcome surprise nearly a dozen matches in, especially as the repetitiveness of those early missions begins to wear on you, and Exoprimal continues to mix it up regularly from there. The variety of objectives in multiplayer increases drastically, with capture points and barriers that must be destroyed with giant hammers you charge by killing dinosaurs. There are also special co-op missions, where both teams work together to fight massive waves of special dinosaurs and even raid bosses against a neo T-Rex. The co-op missions are where the gameplay of Exoprimal truly shines, unleashing an overwhelming number of dinosaurs to fight against. While the first few hours of Exorprimal could use more variety, there is plenty of new content to see later on. The tone is similar to a low-budget sci-fi movie, with all of the main characters talking and acting like it's an '80s action film, with eye-rolling one-liners and unearned bravadoIn addition to the new missions, you get more customization options for your Exosuits based on how long you play and your match performance. There are 10 suits at launch, split into the damage, tank, and support categories. Each category has one suit to unlock by reaching a certain player level and spending the required in-game currency, and each suit has its own individual level. While you can't customize the majority of abilities each suit has, you can choose one rig, which offers a specific skill. In addition to that, there are modules that you unlock that can improve overall stats or exosuit-specific abilities. There are far more modules than you have slots for, so you can tailor your selection to your playstyle. If you like getting headshots as Vigilant, you can pick a module that rewards hitting those skillshots. If you prefer relying on Vigilant's freeze ability, there is a module that improves that skill. While none of these modules feel like game-altering bonuses, the ability to tailor each suit to your playstyle feels rewarding. Capcom made the smart choice of not limiting the number of each suit-type a team can have. Everyone can wear the exact same suit, five different damage suits, or a classic setup with two tanks, two damage-dealers, and a healer, letting your squad implement a wide range of tactics. It also doesn't lock you into a losing setup, either, with the option to switch both your Exosuit and rig at any time during a match with no consequences for doing so. Since most matches are a race, being able to swap quickly when something isn't working is incredibly important and makes it feel like you always have a chance to make a comeback. Another important part of the gameplay are the dinosaurs, of which there are a ton. The most common enemy are the raptors, which primarily serve as cannon fodder meant to overwhelm a team more than anything else. As for the rest of the enemies, each one has something unique about it, giving a different feel. The Triceratops has a hard head, making it take almost no damage from the front, and the Stegosaurus has a loud cry, which disables all non-movement abilities of anyone in range. There are also the neo dinosaurs, which have been modified to have special abilities. These typically include using different elemental attacks, like fire or ice, making for a challenging foe. The stronger dinosaurs force better teamwork to overcome, rewarding smart gameplay and forcing you to adapt on the fly. Leveling up and completing missions offers reward, but the majority of these feel insignificant. Unlocking different modules is great, but the other rewards you earn are loot boxes, awarding random cosmetics and coins, which are used to upgrade modules and unlock new Exosuits. Some of the cosmetics are interesting, like the Krieger suit that turns you into a giant playing card or the Zephyr skin that looks like a Power Ranger, but most are simple color swaps. As for the coins, the economy of Exoprimal is a bit broken. I had what felt like an unlimited number of coins fairly quickly and was able to fully upgrade any module I wanted without feeling like I'm short on cash. These rewards being unexciting meant that the only driving force to boot up another match was seeing what sort of missions Exoprimal still hadn't shown me, and the thrill of fighting dinosaurs. There is a battle pass to progress, but the cosmetic rewards in the premium tier are only marginally better than the selection of free cosmetics. There are a few legendary rewards, but those come near the end of the pass, which takes awhile to progress through. There aren't any challenges, so the only progress comes from completing matches, which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't so slow. Gallery Another flaw of Exoprimal is the matchmaking system, which doesn't offer much control over which matches you get placed into. You can choose either PvP- or PvE-focused missions, or select both for an XP bonus, almost forcing you to pick both. You can't select individual objective types, nor can you queue specifically for the big co-op missions. While this system does typically give a good mix of mission types, it does have one major flaw. The early missions, which have simple objectives and only simple dinosaurs, don't get taken out once you progress in the story. This means you can go from a nail-biting raid fight to fighting only a handful of raptors at once, which feels quite boring and simplistic with late-game modules and upgrades. While Exoprimal's early hours of repetitive and simple missions will likely drive some people away, its later surprises are a delight for those willing to give it the necessary time. The escalation of difficulty and the wide variety of objectives introduced later on in the shooter gives it fresh life several hours in. Fighting through an ocean of dinosaurs is a ton of fun and the variety of enemies keeps you from falling into a repetitive combat loop. The story isn't anything special, but tying it to new multiplayer content makes progressing it a bit more compelling. Exoprimal is ultimately a great time and a unique multiplayer experience.","length":9807,"tokens":2002,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Exoprimal Review - Prehistoric Warfare","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/exoprimal-review-prehistoric-warfare/1900-6418097/","post_date":"August 1, 2023 at 9:49AM PDT","content":"Multiplayer games can live or die based on first impressions, with many games putting their best foot forward by immediately showing off the variety of content they have.

It comes from a mainly South Asian development team, with its aesthetics, character designs, and sound design drawing its inspiration from the culture to tell a story about a South Asian family trying to reclaim and archive their own underrepresented culture after immigrating to Canada. It is an incredibly ambitious title to pursue when many video games do not try to engage with having cultures or identities outside of the white/western represented. Venba is about trying to figure out your own identity (or sometimes lack thereof) in an all-new environment. This new environment is not kind or accommodating to people who are not considered white, and if you are underrepresented from a culture of color you are swayed and forced to assimilate, leaving what made you unique behind to survive this new place. The game starts off in 1988, when Venba and Paavalan, the two main characters, are arguing right after Venba wakes up. Venba wants to make her husband Paavalan lunch, while Paavalan says he will skip lunch so as not to bother her. Since Paavalan is not the best at cooking, Venba gets up and heads straight to the kitchen. This is where the main gameplay mechanics of the game start. You will be making idli, a fluffy rice cake from lentil batter. Here, you will be able to use Venba’s mother’s recipe book on how to make the dish, but some of the instructions are too unclear to follow accurately. This difficult-to-decipher recipe book creates interesting obstacles throughout the game when making different dishes, so it is up to you as the player to make use of the surrounding instructions and diagrams to fill in the gaps. This obstacle starts off with one or two lines from the recipe missing to later on becomes a whole page with just diagrams to work with and no legible instructions (for non-Tamil readers) to tackle cooking a meal properly. The recipe book mechanic aptly showcases the game’s narrative through its gameplay mechanics, allowing players to feel what it’s like to want to express your own culture from your roots and familial bonds, but not being able to completely translate it in challenging environments. In this case, Venba does not have her mother’s consistent guidance directly as she is back home in India, but through a secondary resource with the recipe book it can be accomplished with a lot of trial and error. It’s not just about making the dish; Venba thinks about how her idlis, in comparison to her mother’s, are not as soft or as fluffy, but strives to ensure that maybe they could be just as good with the aid of the recipe book granted to her. It is about doing the dish justice, but also bringing a taste of home to an unfamiliar new place. The game does allow you to ask for hints and provides background information on what you are cooking. For example, you can learn that idlis are a breakfast staple and if they are not stacked properly or steamed with a towel, the batter can leak, spill, or not cook thoroughly. This context then provides guidance on how the dish should come together. Thankfully, the game is very accommodating in giving help to progress the cooking segments. The attempts you make to create these dishes mirror the struggles Venba herself faces in trying to recover these lost recipes. You will need to place ingredients in bowls or containers in the proper order, stack them correctly, or sift certain ingredients a few times to make sure you use all of the ingredients you are given and that none are wasted. It can get tricky fairly quickly, but it is supposed to be tricky trying to use an old recipe book with scratches, stains, and damaged pages. Cooking requires more steps later on and provides enough of a challenge that you may often use hints for some of the steps. You can play chapters again to complete the cooking segments without errors but, unfortunately, you will need to parse the dialogue/story you have already read to attempt cooking those recipes. There is no option to just dive outright into the previously played cooking sections. It is an incredibly ambitious title to pursue when many video games do not try to engage with having cultures or identities outside of the white/western representedThese cooking segments are inspiring and when you see the finished product, it can make you feel empowered to attempt these dishes at home. Yes--Indian food can be ordered from a restaurant, but making your own creates opportunities to bring unique flavors and ingredient choices, as well as create a personal connection to a dish in a way that a restaurant cannot replicate. Food is not just about being satiated or staving off hunger, it is also about reminiscing, salvaging, and appreciating where you (or others) come from; especially in an environment that is not even accommodating to gathering the ingredients for your own precious dishes due to cost. In one example, this is highlighted when Venba uses idlis to reveal important life-changing information to her husband early on in the game: Food is more than just something people eat, it can be used to communicate and express yourself. The story jumps to different years in the life of Venba and Paavalan. Their son Kavin’s early years are depicted and we get to see him heading off to university too. The story jumps around to these different years with different subject matters explored, but themes and adversities that many immigrants and/or South Asians directly face remain close. One such example shows Kavin having his friends anglicize his name to “Kevin” because he wants to fit in, or not eating his lunch at school because he knows the other kids will make fun of the smell. These experiences could be seen as generic or cliche, but they are what many immigrants of color face. Anglicizing or shortening your name to fit in and not be a burden because someone cannot use your full name or its correct spelling is extremely common amongst South Asians. These depictions are an opportunity to explore the game’s themes without overly relying on cooking, and the game uses them well. These scenes can also be triggering and unearth memories of the past, as they depict common experiences South Asians tend to face from an early age trying to navigate their community. Venba was a teacher in India who could easily joke and excite her class to learn, but in Canada, she finds trouble relating to her students and struggles to be accepted for a position as a teacher. And Paavalan faces similar difficulties despite having a Bachelor of Science in Physics. It is very true to life with the conversations I have had with Indians in my local community, and it’s true of most South Asian communities that well-educated and accomplished people find themselves with little to no prospects in foreign societal structures. I cannot help but relate to many of the emotionally resonant scenes and situations these characters face, even though they are not my own exact experiences as a South Asian immigrant. This is a great indication that the developers have achieved their goals. Outside of the cooking mechanics, you'll pick dialogue options in conversations with other characters. There is replayability in making different dialogue choices or going back to create past dishes without making mistakes. Still, since the game has an extremely specific narrative throughline, these slight dialogue choices feel negligible. I would have been more content to follow along to read all of the game’s dialogue with all of the lines presented rather than having to go back to experience a few lines I missed because of the dialogue option I chose, especially since the changes and additions aren’t significant. The cooking segments are about having agency as Venba, but I felt choosing dialogue options was an unnecessary addition. These themes all unfold with nuance and meticulously show that this family, their lives, and their experiences are not seen as important as the others in their community--that they will always be outsiders. But even with all of these disasters the family faces, there is one constant: food. With food, you dive directly in as a player making different South Asian cuisines while Indian music with lyrics plays—a process that delights in letting Venba and the family be unapologetically South Asian and find strength in it. Its original soundtrack is inspired by the Tamil music the developers heard growing up, and I could not help but nod along through the cooking segments. It is refreshing and rejuvenating to hear this kind of music in a game. Personally, I do not listen to Indian or Tamil music at all, but this soundtrack is so intricately crafted with beautiful vocals that it will be added to my playlist due to the positive experiences this game has left me with. In these moments of cooking, Venba and her family can distance themselves from their daily onslaught of problems to reach a peaceful state of mind by emboldening themselves with their culture, and that is elevated by the game’s original soundtrack. It all comes together to reassure you directly and gives you a glimmer of hope that these characters will be fine. Eventually. Hopefully. Gallery On larger recipes such as the biriyani that includes layering, it will take much longer to complete, but because it is a cooking segment that takes longer than previous ones, I found that the music in sections such as that loops too abruptly and made me flinch in disdain. The abnormal music looping feels irregular and did take me out of the game’s focus a few times. The game’s storybook art style compliments the game’s cooking segments nicely in a similar way, especially as it reflects the journey of these characters. It very much looks and feels like a cartoon you would watch or a popup book you would open from India. Throughout the game, you can visually tell that Kavin is drifting away from his culture and his family more, so his dialogue boxes reflect that gradual shift by being tarnished. This starts out as an inkling, but when you initially catch it, it really is a subtle way to show this shift. It feels like a natural way to foreshadow the theme. Having South Asian developers, all with different experiences, means Venba is a narrative cooking adventure about an immigrant mother’s life that feels authentic. It is told through her culture’s cuisine in a way that will make players empathize and sympathize. But it isn’t downbeat or drab, it’s vivid, colorful, and inspiring. Its ending, however, had me sit there and grapple with my thoughts after its two-hour playtime, thinking about how it is never too late in life to discover or rediscover your racial/cultural identity as a South Asian individual. Sometimes a recipe for idli can be the first step in finding the resolve to be yourself and discovering pride in your roots.","length":10905,"tokens":2203,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Venba Review - Tourist To Your Own Culture","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/","post_date":"July 31, 2023 at 10:18PM PDT","content":"Venba is a game that has been on my radar since its announcement trailer was released in 2020. It comes from a mainly South Asian development team, with its aesthetics, character designs, and sound design drawing its inspiration from the culture to tell a story about a South Asian family trying to reclaim and archive their own underrepresented culture after immigrating to Canada. It is an incredibly ambitious title to pursue when many video games do not try to engage with having cultures or identities outside of the white/western represented. Venba is about trying to figure out your own identity (or sometimes lack thereof) in an all-new environment. This new environment is not kind or accommodating to people who are not considered white, and if you are underrepresented from a culture of color you are swayed and forced to assimilate, leaving what made you unique behind to survive this new place.","content_length":907,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Venba Review - Tourist To Your Own Culture","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/","post_date":"July 31, 2023 at 10:18PM PDT","content":"The game starts off in 1988, when Venba and Paavalan, the two main characters, are arguing right after Venba wakes up. Venba wants to make her husband Paavalan lunch, while Paavalan says he will skip lunch so as not to bother her. Since Paavalan is not the best at cooking, Venba gets up and heads straight to the kitchen. This is where the main gameplay mechanics of the game start. You will be making idli, a fluffy rice cake from lentil batter. Here, you will be able to use Venba’s mother’s recipe book on how to make the dish, but some of the instructions are too unclear to follow accurately. This difficult-to-decipher recipe book creates interesting obstacles throughout the game when making different dishes, so it is up to you as the player to make use of the surrounding instructions and diagrams to fill in the gaps.","content_length":828,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Venba Review - Tourist To Your Own Culture","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/","post_date":"July 31, 2023 at 10:18PM PDT","content":"This obstacle starts off with one or two lines from the recipe missing to later on becomes a whole page with just diagrams to work with and no legible instructions (for non-Tamil readers) to tackle cooking a meal properly. The recipe book mechanic aptly showcases the game’s narrative through its gameplay mechanics, allowing players to feel what it’s like to want to express your own culture from your roots and familial bonds, but not being able to completely translate it in challenging environments. In this case, Venba does not have her mother’s consistent guidance directly as she is back home in India, but through a secondary resource with the recipe book it can be accomplished with a lot of trial and error.","content_length":717,"content_tokens":145,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Venba Review - Tourist To Your Own Culture","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/","post_date":"July 31, 2023 at 10:18PM PDT","content":"It’s not just about making the dish; Venba thinks about how her idlis, in comparison to her mother’s, are not as soft or as fluffy, but strives to ensure that maybe they could be just as good with the aid of the recipe book granted to her. It is about doing the dish justice, but also bringing a taste of home to an unfamiliar new place. The game does allow you to ask for hints and provides background information on what you are cooking. For example, you can learn that idlis are a breakfast staple and if they are not stacked properly or steamed with a towel, the batter can leak, spill, or not cook thoroughly. This context then provides guidance on how the dish should come together. Thankfully, the game is very accommodating in giving help to progress the cooking segments.

In an era when you could expect most Disney games to be of pretty good quality (with some outliers--I'm looking at you, Mickey Mousecapade and Fantasia), these two titles stood out for being solid platformers with fun mechanics that also integrated that trademark Disney whimsy and wonder into the mix. The developers of the cartoon-themed action platforming title Disney Illusion Island have said that it chose the word \"Illusion\" for its title because it conveys a sense of high-quality adventure based on those games' legacy. That's a pretty high bar to shoot for and there are a few major flaws that keep it just short of legendary greatness. But, in many ways, Illusion Island manages to hit the mark. The premise of Illusion Island sees Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy getting invited to an off-the-grid location for a charming summer picnic. This turns out to be a ruse to bring them to the island of Monoth, which is reeling from having three magical tomes stolen. The cartoon crew needs to recover these books to both prevent impending disaster and get that tasty outdoor outing they were promised. It's a simplistic story but it's presented well enough: Important events are depicted in lengthy animated cutscenes, while more gameplay-focused happenings are usually delivered through text boxes. If there's any real fault in the narrative, it's that it often tries to be a bit too witty. Ultimately, though, the plot is just a means to set our heroes off on an adventure through Monoth, a bright and colorful world featuring a multitude of different biomes ranging from forests and farmland to cloudy, star-studded gardens to mechanical mailrooms to ocean depths. Everything's connected through a massive but tightly-designed map in a way that keeps load times to a minimum and allows one area to visually flow seamlessly into the next. It's impressive just how good Illusion Island looks. The backgrounds are colorful, vibrant, and full of little animations and details that give them a sense of life. The animations on the characters and enemies are buttery-smooth, with a bouncy, squishy toon edge that makes their motions pop. The attention to detail extends as far as giving each of the four playable characters unique animations for the same skills: While Minnie's floating skill sees her using a parasol, Goofy maintains airtime with blasts from a comically oversized mustard bottle, and poor Donald gets stuck frantically waving two feathers in his hands. The superb visuals make watching the game feel inviting and engaging. Those visuals are what carry the beginning of the game, however, because the initial portion of Illusion Island is downright dull. Illusion Island is unusual in that it completely de-emphasizes combat in favor of pure platforming and exploration--there's not even so much as a cartoon mallet to conk enemies with. But when you're starting out, those movement skills are limited, and enemy and obstacle variety is practically nonexistent, making for very basic platforming and dodging until you get a few more skills for the characters' repertoire. The first 90 minutes or so of Illusion Island are passable at best and a chore at worst. It's only when your movement options expand and more distinct and challenging threats are introduced that things really start to feel fun. Some of the skills you'll acquire include a double jump, a wall jump, a grappling hook, a ground pound, and a hover. What starts out as very simple platforming challenges quickly and surprisingly becomes more difficult. At first, I felt like the game's platforming was intentionally designed in a simple manner for younger players, but towards the endgame I was encountering devious platforming challenges that asked for careful timing, fully testing my knowledge of the game's mechanics. Skills flow into each other smoothly with easy-to-grasp controls, helping make the challenges of the later portions much more manageable--and, as part of the game's family-oriented appeal, there are numerous difficulty-adjustment options for health, controls, and overall timing should players want to use them. Adding to the fun of movement and the challenge of exploration are a wealth of hidden rooms containing goodies and collectibles: Glimts that reveal pieces of a puzzle, Tokuns with pictures and bios of all of Monoth's residents, and memorabilia from classic cartoons featuring Mickey and the gang. Only one of these has a substantial gameplay effect--getting enough Glimts grants a permanent health upgrade--but the others are equally fun to find and look at on your collection screen. My personal favorite collectible, however, is the Hidden Mickeys. Well-known to Disney aficionados, Hidden Mickeys are pieces of background architecture shaped like the well-known mouse ears and are often a part of scenery design in Disney parks. There are lots of Hidden Mickeys in the scenery of Monoth, and after you get the camera item, you'll be able to snap photos in front of them, and each one has a uniquely silly selfie accompanying it. As fun as exploration is, however, it's hindered by the lack of fast travel: You aren't able to travel freely to checkpoints until almost the very end of the game, meaning that backtracking to use your new skills in previously-visited places is a very unappealing prospect.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Every so often during the six-to-nine hours a run-through of Illusion Island comprises, you'll have a boss encounter. Since the gang lacks offensive abilities, bosses are usually designed around defeating them in other ways--generally by breaking a set of targets surrounding them using a movement skill while dodging increasingly dangerous hazards. It's an interesting approach to boss design, but it loses appeal fairly quickly since smashing a bunch of unrelated objects to deal damage doesn't feel satisfying. The boss battles often tend to drag, as well, going through multiple phases with little variation aside from the number and severity of hazards you need to dodge. Ultimately, what should be a high point of the game winds up being one of its worst elements. I've mostly talked about the single-player experience, but one of the key points of Illusion Island is that it allows for up to four players to explore at once in local co-op--a rarity for the genre. This does change up the overall flow of the game fairly significantly, as it makes exploring and collecting much faster and reduces the risk a single player has to assume. For example, in a big room with several collectibles and switch puzzle mechanics, a group can designate a player to be the switch-hitter while others go after the goodies, rather than having one player do everything and backtrack. Multiplayer also makes the boss battles feel a lot less plodding since multiple targets can be taken out at the same time. There are also several skills that can only be used during multiplayer. It's a very cool feature--especially for family play since each player can set their own health when they start, including invincibility--and the fact that the map design works for both single- and multiplayer is quite commendable. Illusion Island has a lot going for it: It looks great, controls wonderfully, is packed with charm and character, offers enjoyable exploration, and features a memorable multiplayer experience. If you're a big fan of the genre, you'll get a kick seeing little references to other all-time classics, too. However, the slow start and the blase boss battles put a bit of a damper on the whole thing, especially if you plan on going on this trip solo. It's well worth playing provided you can get over the initial hump, and even better if you've got a younger family member to share the journey with. It may fall short of being an all-time gem, but Illusion Island's still earned its place in the Disney Vault of Gaming Goodness.","length":8411,"tokens":1785,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"Among the best-remembered Disney games are Castle of Illusion and World of Illusion on the Genesis/Mega Drive.

Those visuals are what carry the beginning of the game, however, because the initial portion of Illusion Island is downright dull.","content_length":1000,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"Illusion Island is unusual in that it completely de-emphasizes combat in favor of pure platforming and exploration--there's not even so much as a cartoon mallet to conk enemies with. But when you're starting out, those movement skills are limited, and enemy and obstacle variety is practically nonexistent, making for very basic platforming and dodging until you get a few more skills for the characters' repertoire. The first 90 minutes or so of Illusion Island are passable at best and a chore at worst. It's only when your movement options expand and more distinct and challenging threats are introduced that things really start to feel fun. Some of the skills you'll acquire include a double jump, a wall jump, a grappling hook, a ground pound, and a hover. What starts out as very simple platforming challenges quickly and surprisingly becomes more difficult.","content_length":864,"content_tokens":172,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"At first, I felt like the game's platforming was intentionally designed in a simple manner for younger players, but towards the endgame I was encountering devious platforming challenges that asked for careful timing, fully testing my knowledge of the game's mechanics. Skills flow into each other smoothly with easy-to-grasp controls, helping make the challenges of the later portions much more manageable--and, as part of the game's family-oriented appeal, there are numerous difficulty-adjustment options for health, controls, and overall timing should players want to use them. Adding to the fun of movement and the challenge of exploration are a wealth of hidden rooms containing goodies and collectibles: Glimts that reveal pieces of a puzzle, Tokuns with pictures and bios of all of Monoth's residents, and memorabilia from classic cartoons featuring Mickey and the gang.","content_length":877,"content_tokens":173,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"Only one of these has a substantial gameplay effect--getting enough Glimts grants a permanent health upgrade--but the others are equally fun to find and look at on your collection screen. My personal favorite collectible, however, is the Hidden Mickeys. Well-known to Disney aficionados, Hidden Mickeys are pieces of background architecture shaped like the well-known mouse ears and are often a part of scenery design in Disney parks. There are lots of Hidden Mickeys in the scenery of Monoth, and after you get the camera item, you'll be able to snap photos in front of them, and each one has a uniquely silly selfie accompanying it.","content_length":634,"content_tokens":133,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"As fun as exploration is, however, it's hindered by the lack of fast travel: You aren't able to travel freely to checkpoints until almost the very end of the game, meaning that backtracking to use your new skills in previously-visited places is a very unappealing prospect.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot.","content_length":594,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4170845-feat. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Every so often during the six-to-nine hours a run-through of Illusion Island comprises, you'll have a boss encounter. Since the gang lacks offensive abilities, bosses are usually designed around defeating them in other ways--generally by breaking a set of targets surrounding them using a movement skill while dodging increasingly dangerous hazards. It's an interesting approach to boss design, but it loses appeal fairly quickly since smashing a bunch of unrelated objects to deal damage doesn't feel satisfying. The boss battles often tend to drag, as well, going through multiple phases with little variation aside from the number and severity of hazards you need to dodge. Ultimately, what should be a high point of the game winds up being one of its worst elements.","content_length":895,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"I've mostly talked about the single-player experience, but one of the key points of Illusion Island is that it allows for up to four players to explore at once in local co-op--a rarity for the genre. This does change up the overall flow of the game fairly significantly, as it makes exploring and collecting much faster and reduces the risk a single player has to assume. For example, in a big room with several collectibles and switch puzzle mechanics, a group can designate a player to be the switch-hitter while others go after the goodies, rather than having one player do everything and backtrack. Multiplayer also makes the boss battles feel a lot less plodding since multiple targets can be taken out at the same time. There are also several skills that can only be used during multiplayer.","content_length":797,"content_tokens":162,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Disney Illusion Island Review - Mousecapades","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/","post_date":"July 28, 2023 at 4:07PM PDT","content":"It's a very cool feature--especially for family play since each player can set their own health when they start, including invincibility--and the fact that the map design works for both single- and multiplayer is quite commendable. Illusion Island has a lot going for it: It looks great, controls wonderfully, is packed with charm and character, offers enjoyable exploration, and features a memorable multiplayer experience. If you're a big fan of the genre, you'll get a kick seeing little references to other all-time classics, too. However, the slow start and the blase boss battles put a bit of a damper on the whole thing, especially if you plan on going on this trip solo. It's well worth playing provided you can get over the initial hump, and even better if you've got a younger family member to share the journey with. It may fall short of being an all-time gem, but Illusion Island's still earned its place in the Disney Vault of Gaming Goodness.","content_length":955,"content_tokens":202,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Remnant 2 Review - What The Dog Doing?","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnant-2-review-what-the-dog-doing/1900-6418092/","date":"July 20, 2023 at 7:48AM PDT","content":"Remnant 2 is the kind of sequel that improves upon its predecessor in almost every facet.

Characters such as McCabe and Rigs return, but they're one-note vendors like before, while the friend you arrived with and risked your life to save performs the same static role. There are more interesting characters found in the various realms you'll visit throughout the game; however, the game's procedurally generated structure ensures that it takes a few playthroughs to form a clear picture of the lore and composition of each world, and by that point you'll have probably forgotten everything you learned previously, such as the abundance of abstract concepts verbally thrown your way. The ending's emotional payoff lands flat as a result. These narrative failings are one of the few areas where Remnant 2's procedural generation actively works against it, because its ambitious implementation is otherwise excellent. Much like the first game, the layout of each realm and the dungeons therein are randomly generated with every playthrough. Enemy placement, meanwhile, changes whenever you return to a location, reload after death, or rest at a checkpoint. These procedurally generated combat scenarios add an element of unpredictability to each enemy encounter that isn't found in other Souls-likes and ratchets up the tension, but Remnant 2 also takes things a step further by dynamically generating almost every aspect of your adventure. Boss fights, side quests, the NPCs you'll meet, and even the opening tutorial all differ from player to player and from one playthrough to another. My first venture in the realm of Losomn, for example, saw me take a grimy trek through the ankle-high waters of a repugnant sewer, yet upon returning in the game's Adventure Mode--which I'll get to soon--I happened upon a derelict sanatorium instead. This creepy, run-down facility featured its own distinct storyline, characters, unique weapons, and sequence of shootouts and boss fights, and this degree of variation and unpredictability is crucial because you're encouraged to revisit areas in order to supplement Remnant 2's reworked buildcrafting. Upon arriving in Ward 13, you're asked to pick from a selection of distinct Archetypes. These classes are similar to those found in Remnant: From the Ashes, with your choice dictating your starting weapons and armor. This time around, however, each Archetype also has a number of perks and skills associated with it, which unlock as you level up. These are based on your chosen Archetype's role, whether you're a Medic, a class like the Hunter that focuses on ranged damage and marking enemies, or the Challenger and its close-range proficiency. I opted for the Handler purely because it gives you a canine companion to fight beside. There's just something about battling monstrous hordes in tandem with man's best friend that makes perfect sense. Aside from kiting damage and attacking enemies, one of my dog's perks allowed them to revive me if I was downed, while others would increase stats like damage and movement speed when we were near one another. Each Archetype can also equip one of three unique skills that are governed by a cooldown meter, typically enhancing one of your classes' specialized abilities. While Archetypes were an afterthought in the previous game, these changes to how they work in the sequel make your initial selection an important one, placing Remnant 2 more in line with other class-based shooters. Once you've picked a class, however, you're not locked into that decision for the rest of the game. You can discover each of the other Archetypes while playing, though doing so is easier said than done--I only found two during my playthrough. That said, I could swap out my initial selection for either one at any time. Once you've reached the max level of 10 on a particular Archetype, however, you can then equip dual Archetypes, thus unlocking double the perks and skills. This is where Remnant 2's buildcrafting comes into its own, letting you mix and max disparate Archetypes to create some interesting amalgamations. Whether you're merging a DPS class with a support type or combining the long-range perks of the Hunter with the short-range aptitude of the Challenger, there are some fun concoctions to be made. Remnant 2Gallery Outside of this, you can also equip a plethora of rings, amulets, and mods to further strengthen your build. These mods can be applied to weapons to create alternate fire modes, such as letting you unleash a helix of missiles that divide into smaller rockets on impact, or surprising enemies by launching an egg that cracks open to reveal a horde of angry space crabs. You can't attain all of these mods and trinkets in a single playthrough, but rather than starting the campaign over again, you can simply hop into Adventure mode. This is essentially a shortened version of the campaign, giving you the chance to replay a single realm if you want to search for unique drops or see all of the different permutations of bosses, areas, and so on, without starting from scratch. It's an ingenious way of extending the game's lifespan while also letting you upgrade your character without grinding well-trodden ground. It helps that Remnant 2's no-nonsense combat is much improved over the first game. Movement is responsive to the point where it never feels like you're fighting the controls in order to evade danger. The assortment of weapons on offer is generally fun to use, too, each packing a satisfying punch as you send lead coursing through bulky robots and slithery tree monsters. It's the sort of game that gets better the longer you play, as your build comes into focus and you begin to hone in on your preferences and unlock some of the more creative boss weapons. Combat isn't outstanding in any one area, but it's rewarding enough, and the core gameplay loop quickly digs in its hooks to the point that it becomes difficult to put down. The only time this feeling dissipates is during your journey through the final realm, when a lack of respite leads to frustration. Rather than focusing on challenging combat puzzles, these final few battles are more like acts of attrition as you're constantly swarmed by mobs of enemies. On numerous occasions, I was revived by my dog only to die before being able to move again. It's a difficulty spike that feels cheap and unearned, especially since Remnant 2 rectifies a similar issue the first game suffered from where boss fights were regularly saddled with too many mobs. The realms you're sent to explore are at least more visually arresting this time around, featuring a broader color palette than the frequent browns and greys of the first game. The clash of art styles sometimes feels a little slapdash, but the concept of these divergent realms means there doesn't necessarily need to be a cohesive throughline. One moment you'll be traversing a gaudy castle adorned in gold and decorated with opulent statues, while an hour or so later you might be blasting rifle-toting villagers as the game indulges its From Software comparisons by whisking you off to a Yharnam-adjacent town. It's not just the visuals that have improved either. The addition of more verticality ensures that enemies can appear from almost anywhere, while the size of each area has expanded, making long-range weapons like sniper rifles more viable. Remnant 2 is exactly what you want from a sequel, such is the way it expands and improves upon the first game's ideas. It's not likely to blow you away, but the core gameplay loop--built on rewarding combat, an ever-expanding repertoire of skills and abilities, and the randomness of its procedural generation--latches on and refuses to let go. The final realm is disappointing because of an artificial difficulty spike, and the story is still lackluster and easy to ignore, but those looking for a solid and malleable shooter won't go far wrong with Remnant 2.","length":11516,"tokens":2473,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Remnant 2 Review - What The Dog Doing?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnant-2-review-what-the-dog-doing/1900-6418092/","post_date":"July 20, 2023 at 7:48AM PDT","content":"Remnant 2 is the kind of sequel that improves upon its predecessor in almost every facet.

You can't attain all of these mods and trinkets in a single playthrough, but rather than starting the campaign over again, you can simply hop into Adventure mode. This is essentially a shortened version of the campaign, giving you the chance to replay a single realm if you want to search for unique drops or see all of the different permutations of bosses, areas, and so on, without starting from scratch. It's an ingenious way of extending the game's lifespan while also letting you upgrade your character without grinding well-trodden ground.

The assortment of weapons on offer is generally fun to use, too, each packing a satisfying punch as you send lead coursing through bulky robots and slithery tree monsters. It's the sort of game that gets better the longer you play, as your build comes into focus and you begin to hone in on your preferences and unlock some of the more creative boss weapons. Combat isn't outstanding in any one area, but it's rewarding enough, and the core gameplay loop quickly digs in its hooks to the point that it becomes difficult to put down. The only time this feeling dissipates is during your journey through the final realm, when a lack of respite leads to frustration. Rather than focusing on challenging combat puzzles, these final few battles are more like acts of attrition as you're constantly swarmed by mobs of enemies.","content_length":937,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Remnant 2 Review - What The Dog Doing?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnant-2-review-what-the-dog-doing/1900-6418092/","post_date":"July 20, 2023 at 7:48AM PDT","content":"On numerous occasions, I was revived by my dog only to die before being able to move again. It's a difficulty spike that feels cheap and unearned, especially since Remnant 2 rectifies a similar issue the first game suffered from where boss fights were regularly saddled with too many mobs. The realms you're sent to explore are at least more visually arresting this time around, featuring a broader color palette than the frequent browns and greys of the first game. The clash of art styles sometimes feels a little slapdash, but the concept of these divergent realms means there doesn't necessarily need to be a cohesive throughline. One moment you'll be traversing a gaudy castle adorned in gold and decorated with opulent statues, while an hour or so later you might be blasting rifle-toting villagers as the game indulges its From Software comparisons by whisking you off to a Yharnam-adjacent town.

Remnant 2 is exactly what you want from a sequel, such is the way it expands and improves upon the first game's ideas. It's not likely to blow you away, but the core gameplay loop--built on rewarding combat, an ever-expanding repertoire of skills and abilities, and the randomness of its procedural generation--latches on and refuses to let go. The final realm is disappointing because of an artificial difficulty spike, and the story is still lackluster and easy to ignore, but those looking for a solid and malleable shooter won't go far wrong with Remnant 2.","content_length":748,"content_tokens":155,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Pikmin 4 Review - Veggie Might","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pikmin-4-review-veggie-might/1900-6418090/","date":"July 19, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"One of the most prominent apps on my phone is a simple to-do list app. I have a handful of recurring tasks every month or year, along with whatever I jot down as a reminder.

While the diminutive characters never acknowledge it, it's very clear from your surroundings that you've crash landed in a garden. Your surroundings might be checkered with gardening tools or mounds of dirt left by whoever occupied the home. There's a playful sense of scale to the setting that recontextualizes common household objects as massive obstacles or helpful bridges. Sometimes, you fall into a steady rhythm of puzzle-solving and completely forget the nature of your surroundings, until you suddenly pull back and realize there was a giant metal pail or bag of sod just next to where you've been excavating. Pikmin centers mostly around these environmental puzzles, as you guide your band of tiny plant-like Pikmin creatures around, seeking treasures and using their unique skills to traverse the world. A small puddle might seem like an impassable ocean to you and your Pikmin, but toss in a handful of Ice Pikmin and voila, the sea freezes up and you can cross it. Learning about each of the Pikmin's strengths and using them efficiently is part of the relaxing, chore-like cadence of Pikmin 4. The blue Ice Pikmin is one of the new types introduced in Pikmin 4, and as the fresh newcomer, it gets its fair share of attention with puzzles built around its unique attributes. Inversely, some returning Pikmin seem to get the short end of the stick with barely anything to do at all--the white, poison-resistant Pikmin and pink, flying Pikmin were treated like specialist classes, and barely used at all. Rock Pikmin, meanwhile, are hearty little creatures that make noticeably short work of walls, but they appear so late in the game that they aren't as frequently used as they might have been. In fact, for most of my playtime, I stuck almost entirely with the same core team: an even distribution of red, yellow, and blue Pikmin. Rounding out the regular cast of Pikmin is Oatchi, a two-legged dog-like creature. Unlike the Pikmin, which come along in different types and numbers, Oatchi is one-of-a-kind and your constant companion. It has the strength of multiple Pikmin, and you can split up to solve a puzzle. The best part about Oatchi, though, is that he's a rideable mount. Shortly after you get him, he grows big enough for you to ride, so you can hop aboard and explore the stage more quickly. This also makes it easier to visualize where all your Pikmin are. It's a little anxiety-inducing for me to have my Pikmin scattered loosely behind me, even if I know they're supposed to follow. Having them all clinging to Oatchi's fur (felt?) keeps them all together and tidy, and makes it very easy to visualize if one is lagging behind. Keeping your Pikmin close at hand is important because they're vulnerable, both to environmental hazards as well as the critters who roam around the garden. Unlike the gardening implements and backyard decor, these aren't generally recognizable creatures. Most of the otherworldly animals will crush or swallow your Pikmin whole. You can always go back to the ship to gather more Pikmin, but I never liked losing the critters. Part of that is because the other characters in your earpiece mourn their loss, but I also just felt generally uncomfortable with losing a resource, even if it could be refreshed. Especially when encountering a new enemy, it would be easy to get caught up in a new attack pattern or trap that I hadn't anticipated and lose a couple of Pikmin. Oatchi is useful in battle as well--not only can he attack enemies, but charging into enemies flings all of your Pikmin onto an enemy en masse, much faster than you could reasonably fling the little buggers manually. Freezing a large enemy with Ice Pikmin, for example, would risk losing some while you fling them one at a time, but charging into them with Oatchi freezes them almost immediately. Between the added security of keeping my Pikmin close and the combat advantages, riding on Oatchi became my standard mode of playing the game. Others might prefer to treat him like a super-Pikmin, who can dig out and transport treasure faster than the average critter. And while it's a small change, playing this way functionally looks and feels very different than a typical Pikmin game. For the times that you absolutely can't avoid losing Pikmin, there is now a new Rewind Time feature. Previous Pikmin games have offered a do-over at the end of the day, but Pikmin 4 expands the concept by regularly saving. You can't manually save during a day, and it's easy to see how that would be too exploitable, but the auto-saves typically happen every 2-5 minutes, so you never lose too much progress. For those who are very protective of their Pikmin, it's a huge convenience feature to just rewind a few minutes and try an encounter again if you ran into trouble in the interim. In the main exploration areas, which make up the bulk of the game, the Pikmin-tossing combat is incidental and mostly player-initiated. You can almost always keep your distance from a creature if you don't feel adequately prepared, so you're very rarely caught off-guard. Taking on enemies gets a much heavier emphasis in two new modes, which help break up the pacing with varying degrees of success. The more Pikmin 4 leans into fashioning itself after a more traditional game, with competition and fail-states, the more prone it is to getting in its own way. The first is the Night Missions, which take place after dark. These feature the new Glow Pikmin, and only Glow Pikmin, in a tower defense minigame. The presence of a glowing, nectar-like substance attracts and enrages the local fauna, but that nectar also happens to be a vital ingredient in your mission, so you have to protect the hive-like nests where it's generated until morning comes. Only a handful of them are mission-critical, though you can go on many more if you'd like. These aren't terribly difficult, but that feels intentional. The pace of Pikmin 4 is so relaxed that it would seem incoherent to have high-stress tower defense segments. While I'm sure they ramp up in difficulty if you want to do them all, it's nice having an option to do something different that has the same deliberate cadence. The same can't be said for Dandori, the other new game type. Often you'll find Leaflings--other explorers who have gone feral and have leaves covering their faces--and they'll challenge you to Dandori. The game explains that Dandori is a Japanese concept referring to orderly planning and efficiency, and in practice, these come in two varieties. The first is a Dandori Challenge to beat a high score within a time limit, while the other is a competitive Dandori Battle where you gather treasures against an AI opponent. This one is directly competitive, as you can steal one another's treasure and drop special items to disrupt their progress. Both flavors of Dandori felt at odds with the rest of the game. I didn't struggle too much in either type, but I did sometimes have to retry after just barely running out of time. Pikmin 4 is so centered around taking things at your own pace, it's strange having a game type that serves the exact opposite purpose. The in-campaign Dandori Battles are obviously meant to train you for the game's multiplayer mode, which is competitive Dandori against another human player. In fact, one of the very last story-required Dandori Battles introduced a new game mechanic, so it seemed clear that this was meant to serve as training wheels. Dandori against another human player may give the game legs, but I generally avoided playing these battles whenever possible in the campaign, and I can't really imagine wanting to do it against another player. Competitive Pikmin is such an odd concept; even saying it aloud sounds wrong. Pikmin 4 introduces a few other traditional game-like elements with more success. You can enhance Oatchi using the pup power granted by rescuing people, which lets you upgrade your canine companion with a stun power for its charge attack or the ability to withstand extreme cold. This gives you a welcome level of customization to use Oatchi as you like--in my case, I dumped everything into a few factors like speed and the charge attack and didn't see much use in the other upgrades. The other upgrade path comes from equipment, which you can purchase using the raw materials you gather. Those raw materials are also used sometimes to build simple bridges or ramps, though, so I made sure to keep some in reserve. A handful of equipment types are permanent upgrades, like the vital ability to call all Pikmin back to your base, while others are temporary power-ups. As with the Pikmin, I didn't want to waste my precious resources, so I used those sparingly (and sometimes, accidentally). Gallery Captain Olimar is a major factor in the story, but he's not the star. Instead, your mission is to find and rescue him, along with the first Rescue Crew dispatched to rescue Olimar, which also crashed. The distress signal sent out attracted a gold rush of other explorers and curious travelers, giving you plenty of hapless munchkins to rescue. Some turned into Leaflings that you need to challenge to Dandori to rescue, while others are just passed out at the hands of some strange bug-monster. That story, like most of Pikmin 4, is gentle and unobtrusive. It's all just very agreeable and sweet, and there's a certain gratification that comes from directing your little army of plant-people to gather treasures like fruits and Game Boy Advance cartridges. The more Pikmin 4 leans into fashioning itself after a more traditional game, with competition and fail-states, the more prone it is to getting in its own way. Sometimes, it's enough to simply have a relaxing activity.","length":12898,"tokens":2901,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Pikmin 4 Review - Veggie Might","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pikmin-4-review-veggie-might/1900-6418090/","post_date":"July 19, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"One of the most prominent apps on my phone is a simple to-do list app. I have a handful of recurring tasks every month or year, along with whatever I jot down as a reminder.

In the main exploration areas, which make up the bulk of the game, the Pikmin-tossing combat is incidental and mostly player-initiated. You can almost always keep your distance from a creature if you don't feel adequately prepared, so you're very rarely caught off-guard. Taking on enemies gets a much heavier emphasis in two new modes, which help break up the pacing with varying degrees of success.","content_length":887,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Pikmin 4 Review - Veggie Might","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pikmin-4-review-veggie-might/1900-6418090/","post_date":"July 19, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"The more Pikmin 4 leans into fashioning itself after a more traditional game, with competition and fail-states, the more prone it is to getting in its own way.

The presence of a glowing, nectar-like substance attracts and enrages the local fauna, but that nectar also happens to be a vital ingredient in your mission, so you have to protect the hive-like nests where it's generated until morning comes. Only a handful of them are mission-critical, though you can go on many more if you'd like. These aren't terribly difficult, but that feels intentional.

The same can't be said for Dandori, the other new game type. Often you'll find Leaflings--other explorers who have gone feral and have leaves covering their faces--and they'll challenge you to Dandori. The game explains that Dandori is a Japanese concept referring to orderly planning and efficiency, and in practice, these come in two varieties. The first is a Dandori Challenge to beat a high score within a time limit, while the other is a competitive Dandori Battle where you gather treasures against an AI opponent. This one is directly competitive, as you can steal one another's treasure and drop special items to disrupt their progress.

Pikmin 4 is so centered around taking things at your own pace, it's strange having a game type that serves the exact opposite purpose. The in-campaign Dandori Battles are obviously meant to train you for the game's multiplayer mode, which is competitive Dandori against another human player. In fact, one of the very last story-required Dandori Battles introduced a new game mechanic, so it seemed clear that this was meant to serve as training wheels. Dandori against another human player may give the game legs, but I generally avoided playing these battles whenever possible in the campaign, and I can't really imagine wanting to do it against another player.

The other upgrade path comes from equipment, which you can purchase using the raw materials you gather. Those raw materials are also used sometimes to build simple bridges or ramps, though, so I made sure to keep some in reserve.

Portal, for all its devious experiment rooms and conundrums within, is simple to break down and explain to new players, letting its depth reveal itself as you use its mechanics in increasingly complex ways. Baba is You is equally straightforward but can get wildly chaotic when you start truly experimenting with how far you can stretch its word-based combinations. Viewfinder neatly fits into their company. It's a short but engrossing puzzle game with a distinct and captivating central mechanic that is satisfyingly explored across a range of challenging puzzles, each of which left a grin on my face upon arriving at a solution. Viewfinder's core concept lets you take static, 2D images and project them into 3D space in the world around you. For example, a Polaroid shot of an otherwise unassuming staircase can be used to construct a new path to a higher platform once projected into the world, carving out space for itself and destroying anything that might have been there beforehand. The more you play around with it, the more you start understanding different facets of how this power can be used to manipulate the serene and delightfully colorful environments around you. For example, while a picture of a plain wall might only show you what was captured in two dimensions, the effect it has once you apply it to the world is much more, sometimes throwing out whole rooms and important objects from behind it. By the same token, where you place your projections is equally important, too, as large structures that you conjure ahead of you can inadvertently shear the environment in such a way that makes reaching your objective more challenging. ViewfinderGallery Viewfinder starts slowly by only offering you predefined photos that you can find around stages, easing you into the mindset that will be required by later challenges. However, it's not long before it truly lets loose by giving you a camera of your own, letting you capture stills from any angle in a stage and use them to devise your own solutions. This moment feels empowering and liberating, akin to finally being able to fire both portal types in Portal after being forced to solve puzzles with only one. It also comes at just the right time, where the complexity presented by puzzles that give you the exact tools you need to solve them is beginning to wear thin. Without the safety net of being given the pieces you need for a solution and challenging you to find them yourself, Viewfinder entrusts you to create your own solutions that can be as straightforward or wholly unique to the way you deconstruct a problem. The aim of each stage is to reach a teleporter at the end of it, with some obstacles thrown in to keep that from being simple. Sometimes the teleporter needs to be powered by multiple batteries in a level where there might only be one, challenging you to figure out not only how to get them to the right place but also how to conjure duplicates without running out of film. Other times, the teleporter is powered by a network of wires, which can easily be severed if you're reckless with where you project pictures. These networks can be powered by sound or pressure plates, other times holding charge in batteries to give you time to get to a teleporter before it shuts back down. Each of these pieces is presented simply at first but quickly combine together to keep you thinking about how each individual solution can make up a grander, more involved one, often requiring a new revelation about the nature of the core mechanic and how it can work in alternative ways. The concept of capturing a moment is stretched in fascinating ways, pushing you to think not just about the physical attributes you're capturing in each picture but also what state in time they're in. A battery photographed at full charge will retain that when reused in the world, creating opportunities for you to reach what it might be powering without physically having to walk as far to reach it. Viewfinder uses this as a central theme in a string of puzzles, but then quickly builds upon it, incorporating what you've just learned in a more complex puzzle while introducing an entirely new theme for subsequent ones to follow. It keeps the sense of discovery strong and makes each victory feel like one triumph over an impossible problem after another, especially when considering how intricate puzzles become by the end. The way in which Viewfinder can consistently keep this going is revelatory but also is afforded by its relatively brief length at just around four hours for completion. There's just a handful of optional (and truly challenging) stages to tackle and collectibles to find, but Viewfinder can easily be completed in a single sitting, and might be best experienced in that way, too. While each string of puzzles is consistently engrossing to solve, the story that wraps everything together is a little less so. Most of Viewfinder takes place in a simulation, seemingly happened upon by two young researchers looking for a device to help save their current climate from crisis. The simulation was created by some genius engineers as a way to continue working outside of the constraints of time, inviting some introspective ideas about the pursuit of perfection if given the space to do so. ViewfinderGallery Your journey through this simulation is guided by Cait, an artificial intelligence that takes the form of an adorable cat. Aside from the disembodied voice you hear occasionally from your handler in the real world, Cait is the only other character you'll interact with. This isn't an issue, though, given how supportive and encouraging he is as you progress swiftly through each puzzle. But Cait harbors a growing sadness as you approach the end, dissuading you from reaching it in the hopes that he won't be abandoned again. It makes your eventual farewell a poignant moment, emphasizing how strong an impression he made in such a short amount of time. As you venture from one hub to the next, you start getting a better idea about the people who built this place and slowly start piecing together why their pursuit to save the planet might have been in vain, although you'll miss most of this context if you don't take time to read the numerous sticky notes and item descriptions around each level. Even with that, Viewfinder's story lacks the impact that its narrative is seeking, making its eventual conclusion land without any sense of emotion. Aside from Cait, there's no other characters that made enough of an impression to be memorable, which is disappointing given how interesting of a world they constructed for you to play around in. Despite an unsatisfying narrative, the bulk of Viewfinder is spent solving a variety of unique puzzles, and it's here where it never falters. The numerous ways in which Viewfinder manages to stretch its core idea consistently kept me entranced, providing a deeply satisfying loop of deciphering a conundrum and constructing a solution that could be distinct to my playthrough. Given how Viewfinder quickly empowers you with the tools to create your own solutions while challenging you to push your understanding of its world, it's pleasantly surprising how frictionless the entire experience is, never once devolving into tedium or frustration.

Sure, there are moments of levity when the game's characters crack jokes or dabble in a little fun but, like its 2016 predecessor, this dialogue-driven graphic adventure game delights in its unsettling atmosphere. The best parts of the experience are drowned out in the dreadful static of Oxenfree II's unmemorable companion and irritating secondary antagonist, but navigating the game's growing sense of unease as you slowly uncover clues to a greater mystery is an engaging and chilling thrill. Taking place five years after the original game, Oxenfree II has you play as a new protagonist: Riley Poverly. Returning to her hometown of Camena--the part of the mainland closest to the first Oxenfree's Edwards Island--Riley is partnered with the town's resident handyman, Jacob Summers, and tasked to set up transmission radio towers around the coastal town. The seemingly simple job devolves into a much stranger and more dangerous situation, however, as electromagnetic waves take a toll on reality, opening portals to other timelines. As Riley and Jacob struggle to understand what's happening and fix things, they find their efforts repeatedly thwarted by a trio of teenagers who are a part of Parentage, a church-like cult in the area, and lingering supernatural specters. Sometimes choosing to say nothing can also affect how the story plays out. Like its previous games, developer Night School Studio utilizes both a choice- and timing-driven dialogue system, taking note of not only what you say but when you say it. Conversations don't pause to give you a chance to figure out what to say next--like an actual conversation in real life, Riley will have to regularly respond to express interest. During conversations, small thought bubbles will appear above Riley's head as people talk to her, giving you a chance to choose how you speak your mind. Wait too long and these dialogue branches eventually fade away, but speak up too soon and you may interrupt someone just before they absent-mindedly say something that creates a more compelling path in the conversation. In this way, saying nothing at all is just as valid a choice as saying something. The main crux of Oxenfree II is Riley's walkie-talkie, which allows her to stay in regular contact with several characters across Camena, like a park ranger trying to understand the supernatural stuff that's happening and a lonely old fisherman looking for a friend. It's through this walkie-talkie that a great deal of Oxenfree II's conversations occur, and being strategic in how and when you talk can drastically alter the relationships that Riley has with these characters and the ultimate conclusions to their stories. Forging these relationships with what are essentially just voices is the strongest element of Oxenfree II. Compelling writing and a talented voice cast bring these characters to life, and navigating their fledgling friendships through the pressure cooker of a single night of terrifying supernatural activity gets you deeply invested in each one. Riley's regular check-ins and conversations about family with her supervisor Evelyn are especially good and feel increasingly poignant to the game's themes about priorities and finding the strength to move forward in life. (Someone, somewhere needs to give actors Liz Saydah, aka Riley, and Alaina Wis, aka Evelyn, all the awards for how well they bring their characters to life.)Riley's walkie-talkie is her sole lifeline to most of Oxenfree II's cast. There's also something especially unnerving about never seeing most of the people that tether Riley to her current reality, lending further support to the game's themes of isolation. Not providing a face for most of the characters is doubly disquieting when it comes to the main antagonists of the game, ghosts who communicate with Riley from another dimension by splicing together their sentences with phrases and words from different radio broadcasts. Occasionally, they'll gnaw at the festering wounds of Riley's trauma as well, pulling her into visions of the past and future so that she can relive the deterioration of her family life and witness how she pays that generational trauma forward to future generations. Rarely does Oxenfree II go for the jump scare, and the game is stronger for it, building up the unsettling presence of its villains by not giving them a tangible face or easily understood motivation until the very end of the game. Oxenfree II does an incredible job building up the tenuous grasp that Riley has on reality and her desperation in needing her walkie-talkie both as the one major lifeline to her support network and the best way to keep tabs on the voices who want to kill her. So it's baffling that the game then undermines that with additional allies and antagonists who Riley does get to see and put a face to. Riley is regularly accompanied by Jacob, who graciously fills the otherwise dead air while walking back and forth across the map with conversation. However, these conversations are oftentimes boring or, worse, unfunny and cringy. I get the sense that Jacob is meant to be a moral indicator for you, with his behavior and characterization evolving in reflection of how he sees you treat others and him over the course of the game. But this leaves Jacob feeling more like a lost puppy dog than an actual person, his repeated pleas for Riley to validate his life choices growing increasingly irritating over time. By the two-hour mark, I wanted to toss him down a cliff. Olivia, the leader of the trio of teens who serve as the secondary antagonist, isn't as bad as Jacob, though I suspect that's largely because she only pops up in brief moments in the story. The trio's tenuous grasp of the multidimensional ghosts haunting Camena also provides the terrifying yet thrilling opportunity for the game's villains to enact physical damage on the world, not just mental or emotional. Plus, it's easier to discern how your choices are influencing Olivia and her friends, with your actions in regard to all three having major ramifications in the game's two most climactic moments. Olivia's presence lends greater emotional weight to your decisions, rewarding however you want to play Riley with tangible effects on the direction of the story and its overall conclusion. That said, Olivia isn't all that interesting of an antagonistic force, especially in comparison to the dark masters she serves, coming off as snobbish, spiteful, and mean-spirited.<img alt=\"They may wear freaky masks but these teens aren't all that memorable.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">They may wear freaky masks but these teens aren't all that memorable. In spite of these shortcomings, Oxenfree II is still a good game, building on how the first Oxenfree explored someone coming to terms with their guilt in their teenage years to now tackle those same themes from an adult's perspective. Riley is struggling with how her own self-loathing and guilt have left her life feeling static, the voice of past traumas preventing her from moving forward during a period when she feels she needs to. It feels narratively apt that the only way she's able to take that next step forward and do what's best for her is to literally cut through the voices within radio static that's threatening the hometown where she grew up and most of her trauma started. It's a simple metaphor, but it's effective and instantly relatable, especially for anyone feeling a bit stuck in life in their early 30s. The sound design for this game is absolutely killer. Games that aim for a spooky atmosphere live and die by their sound design, and Night School Studio expertly utilizes barely discernible undertones throughout to create the sensation that something supernatural is in the air all around you. I'm of the opinion that a radio is one of the creepiest devices you can put into a thriller or horror game given the strange, almost alien reverberating voices that cascade through the hissing static as you navigate between channels. Those sounds populate Oxenfree II from start to finish like a dying voice trying to claw its way back into our reality. It's just a shame Jacob keeps breaking the tension with his terrible jokes and unremarkable tangents. Oxenfree II is a strong sequel to the original game. A particular secondary character and antagonist drag the experience down a bit but the overall storyline is a satisfying foray into an adult woman's tenuous grasp on reality and her ultimate decision to cut through the static and strive for something better with the help of the friendships forged whilst speaking over a simple walkie-talkie.","length":9197,"tokens":1923,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is quite creepy at times, using time loops, crackling radio static, and the occasional vengeful interdimensional ghost to keep you on your toes.

Taking place five years after the original game, Oxenfree II has you play as a new protagonist: Riley Poverly.","content_length":778,"content_tokens":162,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"Returning to her hometown of Camena--the part of the mainland closest to the first Oxenfree's Edwards Island--Riley is partnered with the town's resident handyman, Jacob Summers, and tasked to set up transmission radio towers around the coastal town. The seemingly simple job devolves into a much stranger and more dangerous situation, however, as electromagnetic waves take a toll on reality, opening portals to other timelines. As Riley and Jacob struggle to understand what's happening and fix things, they find their efforts repeatedly thwarted by a trio of teenagers who are a part of Parentage, a church-like cult in the area, and lingering supernatural specters. Sometimes choosing to say nothing can also affect how the story plays out. Like its previous games, developer Night School Studio utilizes both a choice- and timing-driven dialogue system, taking note of not only what you say but when you say it.","content_length":916,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"Conversations don't pause to give you a chance to figure out what to say next--like an actual conversation in real life, Riley will have to regularly respond to express interest. During conversations, small thought bubbles will appear above Riley's head as people talk to her, giving you a chance to choose how you speak your mind. Wait too long and these dialogue branches eventually fade away, but speak up too soon and you may interrupt someone just before they absent-mindedly say something that creates a more compelling path in the conversation. In this way, saying nothing at all is just as valid a choice as saying something. The main crux of Oxenfree II is Riley's walkie-talkie, which allows her to stay in regular contact with several characters across Camena, like a park ranger trying to understand the supernatural stuff that's happening and a lonely old fisherman looking for a friend.","content_length":900,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"It's through this walkie-talkie that a great deal of Oxenfree II's conversations occur, and being strategic in how and when you talk can drastically alter the relationships that Riley has with these characters and the ultimate conclusions to their stories. Forging these relationships with what are essentially just voices is the strongest element of Oxenfree II. Compelling writing and a talented voice cast bring these characters to life, and navigating their fledgling friendships through the pressure cooker of a single night of terrifying supernatural activity gets you deeply invested in each one. Riley's regular check-ins and conversations about family with her supervisor Evelyn are especially good and feel increasingly poignant to the game's themes about priorities and finding the strength to move forward in life.","content_length":826,"content_tokens":148,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"(Someone, somewhere needs to give actors Liz Saydah, aka Riley, and Alaina Wis, aka Evelyn, all the awards for how well they bring their characters to life.)Riley's walkie-talkie is her sole lifeline to most of Oxenfree II's cast. There's also something especially unnerving about never seeing most of the people that tether Riley to her current reality, lending further support to the game's themes of isolation. Not providing a face for most of the characters is doubly disquieting when it comes to the main antagonists of the game, ghosts who communicate with Riley from another dimension by splicing together their sentences with phrases and words from different radio broadcasts. Occasionally, they'll gnaw at the festering wounds of Riley's trauma as well, pulling her into visions of the past and future so that she can relive the deterioration of her family life and witness how she pays that generational trauma forward to future generations.","content_length":951,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"Rarely does Oxenfree II go for the jump scare, and the game is stronger for it, building up the unsettling presence of its villains by not giving them a tangible face or easily understood motivation until the very end of the game. Oxenfree II does an incredible job building up the tenuous grasp that Riley has on reality and her desperation in needing her walkie-talkie both as the one major lifeline to her support network and the best way to keep tabs on the voices who want to kill her. So it's baffling that the game then undermines that with additional allies and antagonists who Riley does get to see and put a face to. Riley is regularly accompanied by Jacob, who graciously fills the otherwise dead air while walking back and forth across the map with conversation. However, these conversations are oftentimes boring or, worse, unfunny and cringy.","content_length":856,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"I get the sense that Jacob is meant to be a moral indicator for you, with his behavior and characterization evolving in reflection of how he sees you treat others and him over the course of the game. But this leaves Jacob feeling more like a lost puppy dog than an actual person, his repeated pleas for Riley to validate his life choices growing increasingly irritating over time. By the two-hour mark, I wanted to toss him down a cliff. Olivia, the leader of the trio of teens who serve as the secondary antagonist, isn't as bad as Jacob, though I suspect that's largely because she only pops up in brief moments in the story. The trio's tenuous grasp of the multidimensional ghosts haunting Camena also provides the terrifying yet thrilling opportunity for the game's villains to enact physical damage on the world, not just mental or emotional.","content_length":847,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"Plus, it's easier to discern how your choices are influencing Olivia and her friends, with your actions in regard to all three having major ramifications in the game's two most climactic moments. Olivia's presence lends greater emotional weight to your decisions, rewarding however you want to play Riley with tangible effects on the direction of the story and its overall conclusion. That said, Olivia isn't all that interesting of an antagonistic force, especially in comparison to the dark masters she serves, coming off as snobbish, spiteful, and mean-spirited.<img alt=\"They may wear freaky masks but these teens aren't all that memorable.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys.","content_length":820,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/","post_date":"July 12, 2023 at 12:00AM PDT","content":"jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4164349-badguys. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">They may wear freaky masks but these teens aren't all that memorable.

It feels narratively apt that the only way she's able to take that next step forward and do what's best for her is to literally cut through the voices within radio static that's threatening the hometown where she grew up and most of her trauma started. It's a simple metaphor, but it's effective and instantly relatable, especially for anyone feeling a bit stuck in life in their early 30s. The sound design for this game is absolutely killer.

Those sounds populate Oxenfree II from start to finish like a dying voice trying to claw its way back into our reality. It's just a shame Jacob keeps breaking the tension with his terrible jokes and unremarkable tangents. Oxenfree II is a strong sequel to the original game. A particular secondary character and antagonist drag the experience down a bit but the overall storyline is a satisfying foray into an adult woman's tenuous grasp on reality and her ultimate decision to cut through the static and strive for something better with the help of the friendships forged whilst speaking over a simple walkie-talkie.","content_length":851,"content_tokens":166,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"I have to hand it to the development staff of Rain Code: They are very skilled at completely upending your expectations from the get-go.

It reads his thoughts and makes sarcastic comments until there's a mystery to be solved, which is when Shinigami stops time and transforms into a buxom demon maiden to whisk him away to mind-palace Mystery Labyrinths where things get buck-wild. Here, he must battle logic monsters, evade dastardly false-solution traps, and unlock doors with Evidence Keys that Shinigami barfs up in a shower of rainbows. And also maybe crush thought barriers riding Shinigami as a giant kaiju. And play Pop-up Pirate with her in a barrel on the beach. Yeah, it's all just a little weird. Much has been made of the fact that Rain Code's development team helmed the beloved Danganronpa adventure game series, which you'll see (and hear) clearly in the character designs, music, and delightfully outlandish character concepts. The similarities are more than skin-deep, however: Rain Code's gameplay structure is clearly modeled after those games. Each of the game's six lengthy chapters has a plot-heavy setup, a murder, an investigation, and then a collection of minigames to catch the culprit--only, instead of a mass trial run by a malevolent bear-thing, you're braving an extra-dimensional detective dungeon. Even the Logic Deathmatch battles you fight in the dungeons are essentially a remake of Danganronpa's contradiction-hunting Nonstop Debates, but with a sword instead of gun to cut down falsehoods. Yuma, being both a detective trainee and an amnesiac, has some big hurdles to overcome. Fortunately, the other WDO members--a motley crew of quirky weirdos with love-or-hate personality traits--all have a unique supernatural ability of their own, ranging from sensing life energy or revisiting a crime scene from when it was first witnessed in the past, to separating soul from body or phasing through solid walls. Yuma soon finds he can share these special skills with their wielder, and they become crucial during the course of investigations to gather clues and evidence. For example, Yuma can use obnoxious would-be casanova Desuhiko's disguise ability to infiltrate an elite private school where a suspicious murder has occurred in the drama club. Getting to use these abilities is a neat twist, though the times you can actually play around with them are very limited. As host to all of the dark happenings, Kanai Ward itself is a key element of the game: a moist, murky, and foreboding place lined with neon lights and winding passageways. A lot of thought has been put into the art design of the city and its assorted regions, and most chapters offer you a portion of time to explore and admire the various parts of the city freely and talk to NPCs. Unfortunately, that's about all you can do; there aren't any shops or activities to be found here. You can take on some side quests to build up your Detective Rank (and learn helpful Mystery Labyrinth skills via a skill tree), but these quests are universally bland, with bog-standard fetch-quest objectives and wholly unmemorable NPC dialogue, ultimately feeling like needless padding. In contrast, the Mystery Labyrinths that Shinigami creates to close out each chapter are very well-designed and feature plenty of intriguing twists and turns, along with charming banter (and plenty of downright bizarre physical interactions) between Yuma, Shinigami, and other characters who get sucked in for the ride. The portrayal of a logical puzzle as a physical dungeon is an enjoyable conceit that allows the artists and puzzle designers to create some really memorable traps, solutions, and liminal spaces to travel through. While the Switch sometimes struggles with muddy-looking textures and slowdown, the overall art design is a high point, as are the variety of obstacles and glammed-up enemies Yuma must overcome. The variety of obstacles and puzzles is great, too. At one moment you'll be fighting a literal battle of words against a Mystery Phantom opponent who shouts attacks at you, and the next you'll be reconstructing crime scenes or playing a QTE-type event where you need to correctly answer a question quickly in order to escape danger, only to then be faced with Shinigami in a rotating barrel you throw swords at to make a phrase, followed by a finale in which a massive Shinigami must crush all mental barriers that stand between you and the truth… among other things. The mechanics in each of these sub-sections differ but are very easy to understand and get the hang of, making for constantly shifting gameplay that keeps you on your toes. As cool and wild as many of the character designs are in Rain Code, there's simply not enough character interaction for you to feel a strong connection or animosity towards anyone. Both friends and foes alike tend to get a designated chapter to show off their abilities and personality quirks, only to be relegated to minor supporting roles afterwards. Instead, most of the in-game interactions are solely between Yuma and Shinigami, who do have a very entertaining rapport with one another. You can see little side stories with other major characters through finding collectibles, though this requires extra legwork and still doesn't remedy the issue. This lack of character development and attachment is one of the main reasons why Rain Code doesn't hit the same sweet-spot that the Danganronpa games did. Danganronpa games were extremely character-driven, and that fed into the forever-tense, emotional atmosphere: At any moment, a character you really liked could wind up killed horribly, or--perhaps worse--turn out to be a cold-blooded murderer. That fear and inevitability of loss was pervasive and powerful, making every moment feel weighty. Gallery Rain Code doesn't have the same tension and urgency. The victims of the murders are characters you barely know, the threat of a tyrannical mega-corp's unethical experiments is mostly indirect, and some of the big story revelations just don't hit as hard as they should. I also felt like the Mystery Labyrinths, as enjoyable as they were, tended to drag out their conclusions. I'd usually figured out the who and how by around the halfway point in each, meaning I only had to puzzle out how the game wanted me to put everything together. The result is a narrative-driven game with a story that lacks impact where it needs it most and leaves you saying, \"Wait, that's all there is?\" (An ending that wraps things up just a little too nicely given the messy revelations of the final chapter doesn't help, either.)But even though it's not quite as good as Danganronpa's dizzying roller-coaster highs, Rain Code is a solid detective adventure that entertains and engages for the majority of its runtime. It's got an intriguing concept, enjoyable dialogue, an interesting and plenty of bold, outlandish strangeness to hold a player's interest. I, for one, certainly hope this isn't the last we see of Shinigami's sublime snark.","length":10334,"tokens":2303,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"I have to hand it to the development staff of Rain Code: They are very skilled at completely upending your expectations from the get-go.

Each of the game's six lengthy chapters has a plot-heavy setup, a murder, an investigation, and then a collection of minigames to catch the culprit--only, instead of a mass trial run by a malevolent bear-thing, you're braving an extra-dimensional detective dungeon. Even the Logic Deathmatch battles you fight in the dungeons are essentially a remake of Danganronpa's contradiction-hunting Nonstop Debates, but with a sword instead of gun to cut down falsehoods. Yuma, being both a detective trainee and an amnesiac, has some big hurdles to overcome.","content_length":906,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"Fortunately, the other WDO members--a motley crew of quirky weirdos with love-or-hate personality traits--all have a unique supernatural ability of their own, ranging from sensing life energy or revisiting a crime scene from when it was first witnessed in the past, to separating soul from body or phasing through solid walls. Yuma soon finds he can share these special skills with their wielder, and they become crucial during the course of investigations to gather clues and evidence. For example, Yuma can use obnoxious would-be casanova Desuhiko's disguise ability to infiltrate an elite private school where a suspicious murder has occurred in the drama club. Getting to use these abilities is a neat twist, though the times you can actually play around with them are very limited. As host to all of the dark happenings, Kanai Ward itself is a key element of the game: a moist, murky, and foreboding place lined with neon lights and winding passageways.","content_length":958,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"A lot of thought has been put into the art design of the city and its assorted regions, and most chapters offer you a portion of time to explore and admire the various parts of the city freely and talk to NPCs. Unfortunately, that's about all you can do; there aren't any shops or activities to be found here. You can take on some side quests to build up your Detective Rank (and learn helpful Mystery Labyrinth skills via a skill tree), but these quests are universally bland, with bog-standard fetch-quest objectives and wholly unmemorable NPC dialogue, ultimately feeling like needless padding. In contrast, the Mystery Labyrinths that Shinigami creates to close out each chapter are very well-designed and feature plenty of intriguing twists and turns, along with charming banter (and plenty of downright bizarre physical interactions) between Yuma, Shinigami, and other characters who get sucked in for the ride.","content_length":917,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"The portrayal of a logical puzzle as a physical dungeon is an enjoyable conceit that allows the artists and puzzle designers to create some really memorable traps, solutions, and liminal spaces to travel through. While the Switch sometimes struggles with muddy-looking textures and slowdown, the overall art design is a high point, as are the variety of obstacles and glammed-up enemies Yuma must overcome. The variety of obstacles and puzzles is great, too. At one moment you'll be fighting a literal battle of words against a Mystery Phantom opponent who shouts attacks at you, and the next you'll be reconstructing crime scenes or playing a QTE-type event where you need to correctly answer a question quickly in order to escape danger, only to then be faced with Shinigami in a rotating barrel you throw swords at to make a phrase, followed by a finale in which a massive Shinigami must crush all mental barriers that stand between you and the truth… among other things.","content_length":974,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"The mechanics in each of these sub-sections differ but are very easy to understand and get the hang of, making for constantly shifting gameplay that keeps you on your toes. As cool and wild as many of the character designs are in Rain Code, there's simply not enough character interaction for you to feel a strong connection or animosity towards anyone. Both friends and foes alike tend to get a designated chapter to show off their abilities and personality quirks, only to be relegated to minor supporting roles afterwards. Instead, most of the in-game interactions are solely between Yuma and Shinigami, who do have a very entertaining rapport with one another. You can see little side stories with other major characters through finding collectibles, though this requires extra legwork and still doesn't remedy the issue. This lack of character development and attachment is one of the main reasons why Rain Code doesn't hit the same sweet-spot that the Danganronpa games did.","content_length":980,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"Danganronpa games were extremely character-driven, and that fed into the forever-tense, emotional atmosphere: At any moment, a character you really liked could wind up killed horribly, or--perhaps worse--turn out to be a cold-blooded murderer. That fear and inevitability of loss was pervasive and powerful, making every moment feel weighty. Gallery Rain Code doesn't have the same tension and urgency. The victims of the murders are characters you barely know, the threat of a tyrannical mega-corp's unethical experiments is mostly indirect, and some of the big story revelations just don't hit as hard as they should. I also felt like the Mystery Labyrinths, as enjoyable as they were, tended to drag out their conclusions. I'd usually figured out the who and how by around the halfway point in each, meaning I only had to puzzle out how the game wanted me to put everything together.","content_length":886,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/","post_date":"July 6, 2023 at 3:42PM PDT","content":"The result is a narrative-driven game with a story that lacks impact where it needs it most and leaves you saying, \"Wait, that's all there is?\" (An ending that wraps things up just a little too nicely given the messy revelations of the final chapter doesn't help, either.)But even though it's not quite as good as Danganronpa's dizzying roller-coaster highs, Rain Code is a solid detective adventure that entertains and engages for the majority of its runtime. It's got an intriguing concept, enjoyable dialogue, an interesting and plenty of bold, outlandish strangeness to hold a player's interest. I, for one, certainly hope this isn't the last we see of Shinigami's sublime snark.","content_length":683,"content_tokens":151,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/","date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:33AM PDT","content":"There haven't been many games that have adapted the Aliens name that have managed to capture the essence of what makes many of its early films so captivating. The survival-horror game Alien: Isolation comes closest, eschewing the typical direction of action for horror, making its single Xenomorph a terrifying entity that demands the fearful respect so many other adaptations fail to offer it. While there are many, many more Xenomorphs in Aliens: Dark Descent, this hybrid of action and real-time strategy mostly works because it conveys the same sense of fear you feel when engaging them, which makes it easier to gloss over the times its other systems don't quite work as well. Aliens: Dark Descent predominantly takes place on the planet Lethe, after a familiar scene of a Xenomorph outbreak takes place on a Weyland-Yutani space station and forces the entire area into a deadly lockdown. As survivors scramble for a way to get off-planet while also investigating the root of the outbreak, you'll travel to numerous locations across the planet to uncover clues, scavenge for supplies, and shoot down anything that gets in your way. Aliens: Dark Descent has the inklings of a captivating tale that never delivers on any of its initial promises, boiling down an interesting premise in the opening hours to a standard story without much to say beyond its straightforward mystery. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Their chemistry is lacking and their relationship swings wildly from one extreme to the next in very short spaces of time, making it difficult to feel engaged in their plight or personal motivations. Secondary characters rarely get any moments to shine, so it's easy to start tuning the entire thing out in lieu of Dark Descent's far more interesting pieces. Aliens: Dark Descent is a mixture of genres to the point where it can be difficult to pin down exactly which one it conforms to most. Its top-down view and cover mechanics are reminiscent of games like XCOM, but its real-time action borrows a lot from standard action role-playing games like Diablo. During each mission, you assemble a squad of four space marines and control the unit as a single entity. You cannot move individual squad members independently, and soldiers will only break from formation if you instruct them to open a crate or retrieve a collectible, after which they will hurriedly scurry back. This restriction of independent movement allows for Aliens: Dark Descent's atmospheric horror to work, because it keeps your attention focused on one point at all times. Despite having a large view of your surroundings, the restrictive radius around your marines that you can actually see retains a lot of the tension as you explore narrow hallways in derelict outposts or twisting caverns in an infested underground mine. Enemies can, and will, hunt you as you move around these areas, with the recognizable ping from your motion sensor giving you some indication of how close they might be. Just a couple of Xenomorphs are enough to completely tear your squad apart, giving these creatures a sense of power that ratchets up the tension every time you face them. Your space marines exhibit this fear literally in a stress meter that rises as you are hunted by the hive, eventually inhibiting them from performing their alien-slaying duties as effectively as possible. Stress is just one small component of your squad that you will need to manage, but it serves as a good example of numerous small mechanics that all work together to accentuate the tension between skirmishes. Much like in the films, Xenomorphs spray harmful acid blood when injured, meaning your space marines have a chance to take damage if they kill one too close to themselves. This makes moving while engaging enemies paramount, afforded by the ability to shoot if you choose to move at a slower, walking pace as opposed to an all-out sprint, which doesn't let you return fire. Xenomorphs will surprise attack from vents, grabbing the weakest members of your team and dragging them to their demise if you don't stop them. Facehuggers will burst out of eggs and latch onto your squad's faces, rendering the soldier in question dead if you decided not to bring along the required equipment to pry them off. These small moments composed of small decisions are what make even mundane movements between objectives stimulating, forcing you to think about subversion and action over outright action in most scenarios. While there are many, many more Xenomorphs in Aliens: Dark Descent, this hybrid of action and real-time strategy mostly works because it conveys the same sense of fear you feel when engaging them, which makes it easier to gloss over the times its other systems don't quite work as wellStealth is not just a viable tactic, but one that Aliens: Dark Descent encourages with a system that tracks when you're being hunted by the Xenomorph hive. Everything you do that might cause attention, like firing a gun or blowing up a barricade for a shortcut, alerts the hive to your presence, with regular drones being sent out to hunt for you. The longer you're in this hunted state, which is reset every time you alert an enemy, the overall aggressiveness of the hive increases. Eventually this causes larger groups of patrolling enemies, the introduction of special boss enemy types that are much harder to kill, or a brutal onslaught of foes that will routinely wipe your squad out if you aren't prepared. It's an effective way to encourage you to seek out alternative routes or employ stealth when you can but also exposes how valuable extractions can be. Each mission lets you quit at any point and return to fight another day, entrusting you with making decisions that could see you return with a full squad or a battered one limping back with soldiers missing. It's a powerful yet simple mechanic that engrosses you further into the management and preservation of your squad in Dark Descent's brutal environments. Aliens: Dark Descent makes a point of being challenging. It outright warns you of the fact before starting a campaign, and routinely prompts you to prepare before large skirmishes each time you trigger them. However, its encouragement to play in a certain way doesn't always end up providing the most engaging moment-to-moment experiences. While it's fun to devise ways around enemies without drawing their attention, it's equally frustrating when you're forced into the same types of skirmishes consistently because there's so little depth to dealing with recurring climatic encounters. They usually boil down to you being given time to set up some turrets and deciding which soldiers you want to lay down suppressive fire in specific directions, and then mostly passively watching encounters play out where you either come out relatively unscathed or have your entire squad wiped out. The key to addressing failure usually lies in one or two actions (such as using abilities like your deadly close-range shotgun blast or deploying some additional mines), but given how similarly these encounters play out, it quickly falls down the hole of routine rather than strategic stimulation. Outside of missions, the strategic element is just as thin. Between deployments, you're in charge of a base-management system akin to XCOM. You can assign physicians to work on specific troops and reduce their injury times, spend resources you find on missions to unlock a (small) variety of weapons, send troops on training so that they can level up outside of traditional deployments, and a little more. The few options for you to meaningfully enhance your numerous soldiers coupled with their earned upgrades feeling imperceptible makes the decisions imposed by each department come across as meaningless. Beyond assigning physicians, I rarely found myself tabbing to the rest of the departments outside of checking in on a potential new weapon or upgrade, making this entire layer of gameplay more of an annoying necessity between missions rather than a vital one to ensure their success. The composition of squads you send on missions and individual troop progression also feels relatively flat, with little discernible difference from a new recruit to a fully upgraded one when they're out in the field. You assign passive perks and unlock weapon proficiencies as each soldier levels up, which should go some ways to giving each one some memorable personality. But when a single drone can tear apart a fresh recruit or seasoned veteran in about the same amount of time, it's difficult to grow close to ones you've been playing with for several hours. Gallery It's disappointing that Aliens: Dark Descent gets so much right about its setting, only to falter in each of the more critical areas that are meant to hold your attention. Its detail-oriented focus in presenting a richly authentics and atmospheric setting will be welcomed by anyone familiar with the franchise. Smaller mechanics that put emphasis on the terror that Xenomorphs exude add a suitable layer of tension to both exploration and combat, making each more distinct than their initial make-up would suggest. But it's a squad that rarely feels like a personable unit of people that you desperately want to keep alive, fighting for a cause in a narrative that is so easy to tune out well before the halfway point. There's a lot of good in this attempt to make Aliens something fresh and interesting again, and that might be enough to encourage you to see it through. But there's also just enough to potentially derail you entirely.","length":11591,"tokens":2412,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:33AM PDT","content":"There haven't been many games that have adapted the Aliens name that have managed to capture the essence of what makes many of its early films so captivating.

It outright warns you of the fact before starting a campaign, and routinely prompts you to prepare before large skirmishes each time you trigger them.","content_length":948,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:33AM PDT","content":"However, its encouragement to play in a certain way doesn't always end up providing the most engaging moment-to-moment experiences. While it's fun to devise ways around enemies without drawing their attention, it's equally frustrating when you're forced into the same types of skirmishes consistently because there's so little depth to dealing with recurring climatic encounters. They usually boil down to you being given time to set up some turrets and deciding which soldiers you want to lay down suppressive fire in specific directions, and then mostly passively watching encounters play out where you either come out relatively unscathed or have your entire squad wiped out. The key to addressing failure usually lies in one or two actions (such as using abilities like your deadly close-range shotgun blast or deploying some additional mines), but given how similarly these encounters play out, it quickly falls down the hole of routine rather than strategic stimulation. Outside of missions, the strategic element is just as thin.","content_length":1036,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:33AM PDT","content":"Between deployments, you're in charge of a base-management system akin to XCOM. You can assign physicians to work on specific troops and reduce their injury times, spend resources you find on missions to unlock a (small) variety of weapons, send troops on training so that they can level up outside of traditional deployments, and a little more. The few options for you to meaningfully enhance your numerous soldiers coupled with their earned upgrades feeling imperceptible makes the decisions imposed by each department come across as meaningless. Beyond assigning physicians, I rarely found myself tabbing to the rest of the departments outside of checking in on a potential new weapon or upgrade, making this entire layer of gameplay more of an annoying necessity between missions rather than a vital one to ensure their success. The composition of squads you send on missions and individual troop progression also feels relatively flat, with little discernible difference from a new recruit to a fully upgraded one when they're out in the field.","content_length":1049,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:33AM PDT","content":"You assign passive perks and unlock weapon proficiencies as each soldier levels up, which should go some ways to giving each one some memorable personality. But when a single drone can tear apart a fresh recruit or seasoned veteran in about the same amount of time, it's difficult to grow close to ones you've been playing with for several hours. Gallery It's disappointing that Aliens: Dark Descent gets so much right about its setting, only to falter in each of the more critical areas that are meant to hold your attention. Its detail-oriented focus in presenting a richly authentics and atmospheric setting will be welcomed by anyone familiar with the franchise. Smaller mechanics that put emphasis on the terror that Xenomorphs exude add a suitable layer of tension to both exploration and combat, making each more distinct than their initial make-up would suggest. But it's a squad that rarely feels like a personable unit of people that you desperately want to keep alive, fighting for a cause in a narrative that is so easy to tune out well before the halfway point. There's a lot of good in this attempt to make Aliens something fresh and interesting again, and that might be enough to encourage you to see it through.

In Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, it's what leads your farmer to return to Forgotten Valley in hopes of creating a life similar to the idyllic one led by their parents. It's also what led me--clad in my finest, rose-tinted glasses--to revisit A Wonderful Life with its recent remake. As I downloaded this new version of a game I once sunk several hours into for my Nintendo Switch, I reminisced about the first time I played the game two decades ago--the feel of my grandparents' itchy carpet, the satisfying \"click\" of my purple GameCube closing before it kicked into a soft whir... It was never my favorite Harvest Moon game--that spot was reserved for Back to Nature--but it was one that I found unique and enjoyable. In some ways, I also feel that way about its 2023 remake. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a very different type of farming simulator in that it's one that focuses more on relationships, family, and legacy than farm work. It's a concept I can get behind, and A Wonderful Life's emphasis on streamlining gameplay and eliminating tedium is a breath of fresh air. However, despite social-sim dynamics being at the forefront of A Wonderful Life, player interactions and the community itself feel shallow. Although the character creation process might be more involved than ever, few NPCs are memorable, dialogue is scarce, and the game's idyllic setting turns eerie quickly due to the town's vacant atmosphere. Yet if I factor out this less-than-wonderful content, not all that much is left, making A Wonderful Life feel dated and empty--especially when compared to other games in the now-highly saturated farming game genre. The farmer and Takakura find two dogs. Like most farming sims, A Wonderful Life begins with a letter--only this time it's sent from your character rather than to you. After growing tired of life in the city, your character pens a letter to your parents' former friend, Takakura, informing him of your intention to come to Forgotten Valley and take over your parents' old farm. Upon your arrival, Takakura offers your farmer a cow, a decent sum of money, and a tutorial that beautifully walks the fine line between overbearing and uninformative, before giving you total control over your character and farm. This tutorial--and how easy these notes are to access at all times--comes in clutch due to how dramatically different A Wonderful Life is from other farming sims. Whereas games like Stardew Valley and the vast majority of Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons games give you a large, dilapidated field, your A Wonderful Life farm starts in a neat and tidy state with only two small plots of land--one with poor soil quality and one with average quality, a factor which frequently comes into play. The bulk of your farm is a fenced-off field your livestock can graze upon, which quickly informs you that animal husbandry should be your focus and is the biggest money-maker; this is a dramatically different approach to farming sims, which generally rely on crops to get your cash flowing. Ultimately, these qualities actually make A Wonderful Life a great farming sim for genre newcomers to get into--there's less to manage, less to do, and a lot less to worry about. However, for those more familiar with the genre this is only the beginning of the long list of differences. For example, you cannot ship any items you forage or gather in A Wonderful Life--that bin is reserved solely for items you harvest. Instead, you must wait until the traveling salesman Van comes to town or set up your own stall in the center of town, in hopes that your wandering neighbors will see your booth and slowly venture over. Furthermore, a year in A Wonderful Life is only 40 days long, with each season representing 10 of those days and containing one holiday. This means time goes by quickly and tasks that you would generally do daily--such as watering your plants and milking your cow--can and should be done twice a day in this game. This also gives the game the room it needs to span several years, giving players the wonderful opportunity to watch their community change and their future child grow. And while there are a handful of things you can upgrade on your farm and in your inventory, there's zero resource collecting and attaining these upgrades doesn't feel like much of a focus. In fact, rather than having any sort of farming or financial goals, the game emphasizes that you must get married in your first year of living in Forgotten Valley--or else the game will end. One of the town's bachelorettes, Cecilia. This is where you start to experience some friction. While a streamlined farm and shortened calendar sounds great in theory, its execution in A Wonderful Life leaves a lot to be desired. Outside of tending to your farm and picking random herbs and flowers, there are essentially five things you can do: Visit the city, visit the Harvest Sprites to grab a recipe, socialize with your neighbors, mine, and fish. That sounds like a decent amount, right? Here's the problem: Each one of these activities is incredibly shallow and dull. To visit the city, you go to the outskirts of town, indicate that you are willing to spend six hours visiting the city, and then the screen goes black and you return six hours later. I am still not sure if it actually does anything. Visiting the Harvest Sprites entails eating a mushroom, entering their home, and then talking to one of them to get a recipe. If you try talking to the other two, they'll just repeat that they don't have a recipe for you at this time. Mining consists of entering a tiny dig site--probably made up of 15 squares--being handed a shovel, and repeatedly digging at the same squares in an attempt to find fossils. And fishing sees you cast your line, wait for your bobber to sink, and then hold down a button. That is it. However, socialization might be the most frustrating part. Seeing as I am told emphatically and frequently that I need to marry someone in order to live in Forgotten Valley, which of course feels strange in itself, getting to know someone is obviously a big priority. But there are a few problems with this: The folks you can marry are largely stationary and uninteresting, heart events are brief and not particularly gripping, and gifts and dialogue feel impersonal. While I am delighted developer Marvelous added same-sex marriage to the game, it doesn't make up for the fact that the candidates aren't the most lively group of people. I gravitated towards Matthew and Molly in my playthrough, as they exuded the most personality, but everyone else felt more or less one-note. While I ultimately married Matthew, the romance didn't feel engaging or earned. Though I enjoyed Matthew's Darcy-esque personality, it didn't feel as if we got to know one another, bonded, and fell in love. And maybe I'm just sappy, but that's a feeling I'm pretty fond of in any games with a romance element and would have preferred to experience instead of the forced situation we're offered.<img alt=\"The farmer and Takakura visit the nearby farm.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4159410-1%283%29. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4159410-1%283%29. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4159410-1%283%29. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The farmer and Takakura visit the nearby farm. Even in regards to friendship, the town is just… vacant. It's a word I keep coming back to, but one that aptly describes Forgotten Valley, a place where things like a general store, library, school, museum--any sort of lively and purposeful building, really--don't exist. Dialogue is often recycled, the townsfolk seldom interact with each other, and the town is more filled with strange scientists than people who feel like part of a tight-knit community. While there is this core of sentimentality here, you have to look extremely hard to see it--and that ultimately makes for a really isolating experience. Oh, you can also complete item requests for your neighbors, but it happens so infrequently, it's something I'm only just now remembering exists. To be quite honest, there were multiple days I went to bed before the sun had even set--there was nothing to do, no one to see, and standing by a river hitting a button to reel in a fish every 20 seconds just didn't sound super appealing. Some things break up the monotony--holidays, events with your child, and watching them grow up (which is probably the coolest feature and makes the quick calendar worth it) are nice. The game's graphics and music are lovely enough, gameplay is significantly smoother than it was in the original, and its streamlined approach to farming and quality-of-life updates, such as adding NPC icons to your map so you don't have to look very hard to find people, are good features. Unfortunately, the entire package is just not enough. Back in 2003, A Wonderful Life offered a refreshing and sentimental take on the farming sim genre. However, even then, it felt a bit empty when compared to what many other simulation games were doing. While Marvelous added greater inclusivity, clarity, and additional events and dialogue, it doesn't keep this 2023 remake from feeling empty and stuck in the past.","length":9414,"tokens":2044,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Story Of Seasons: A Wonderful Life Review -  Putting The Past In \"Pastoral\"","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life-review-putting-the-past-in-pastoral/1900-6418084/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 1:30PM PDT","content":"Much like an axe, sickle, or hoe, nostalgia is a powerful tool.

Once a single-player mascot platformer at the height of the genre's popularity, CTR takes the heroes and villains of Naughty Dog's, and later Activision's, series and reimagines it as a 4v4 multiplayer game with live-service elements. To some, that might sound like a myopic deathblow to a once-proud series. On the contrary, Crash Team Rumble is a fun and surprisingly tactical PvP game, albeit sometimes held back by oft-seen growing pains of games-as-a-service. In Crash Team Rumble, two teams of four square off in platforming arenas that, at first glance, each look a bit like wide levels from a typical Crash game. Enjoyably, the controls and feel of the game perfectly capture those of traditional Crash games, too, making it an instantly recognizable experience in one's hands. Though the game has just one mode at launch, it's designed very well. The goal is to score 2,000 wumpa fruit before the rival team does. To do this, players will spin over, slam onto, and slide into crates and loose wumpas all around the arena to collect them. Moving them to a goal area will, after a moment, score them for the team permanently. But the exciting chaos of CTR exists in this in-between space, and often even on the goals themselves. The best CTR teams are those in which every teammate knows their role and can pivot to Plan B when needed. Each team can be composed of whichever characters they see fit, which reliably results in rounds playing out differently each time. Eight characters split across three classes are available at launch: scorer, booster, and blocker. Scorers are usually faster and can carry more wumpas, thus scoring more at a time. Blockers are very enjoyable defenders, with denial-of-area or higher damage-inflicting moves meant to constantly disrupt enemy scorers like a fly forever buzzing around their ears. Boosters are sort of the in-betweeners, meant to focus on activating multipliers and unlocking map-specific abilities, like Aku Aku masks that give the whole team a health and movement buff similar to what past Crash games had. Thresholds for unlocking these game-changing abilities are high, but work well as a result. It takes a concerted team effort to obtain them, which means a team will always have to balance chasing those powerful unlocks with scoring or playing defense. All eight players in the arena will have multiple things to focus on at all times, creating a high skill ceiling for those who use their time and space wisely. Each character can be further enhanced with unique skill unlocks that aren't limited to certain classes. You can further enhance Crash's scoring abilities with the Wumpa Stash, giving yourself 100 or more additional wumpas over time, or you could bolster his defensive abilities by dropping a Gasmoxian Guard on the enemy's goal, thereby routinely zapping them and interrupting their scoring attempts, with the added bonus being that taking damage results in dropped wumpas. Characters having both innate and customizable abilities like these allow for further variance from round to round, as even a group of eight identical skins may across two rounds may belie a change in strategy that comes from a change in assigned cooldown skills. In my time with the game, it was easy to take the reins of a new character or ability and quickly figure them out. I definitely have favorites today in both respects, but each character's and skill's use-case is apparent, and it's really satisfying to get to grips with each of them. A team could roll out with four people playing as Crash, a scorer, but they'd be hard-pressed to prevent the enemy team from scoring, too. Alternatively, a team could bulk up on defenders like N. Tropy and Dingodile, but they'd be at risk of scoring too slowly. The game allows players to create their own team comps, which definitely can result in some lopsided matches. However, in my experience, some seemingly deficient team comps still led to victory when the team played cohesively. Voice comms feel more necessary in Crash than in many other PvP games, and as a result of that, I took to mostly playing with my squad of four, enjoying it less when jumping in with random players. All eight players in the arena will have multiple things to focus on at all times, creating a high skill ceiling for those who use their time and space wisely. Crash Team Rumble offers a surprising level of depth despite having just the one game mode right now. It very much feels like a quasi-sports game, akin to Rocket League or Fall Guys, just as much as it still retains the classic feel of a Crash game. I find this to be its greatest attribute--creating something new that still feels immediately familiar and easy to understand. While strategies change from round to round, the game is consistently frenzied. Each player has goals and intentions, but they can change on a dime. I would often laugh when blockers got tunnel vision for me, thereby chasing me down fruitlessly (no pun intended) as my mobility options were greater than theirs, and this chase sequence allowed my allies to take advantage in other ways, like activating multipliers or scoring their own wumpas. In other rounds, my brother and I would align as dual N. Brio blockers, each with Gosmoxian Guards equipped. These area-of-effect behemoths, paired with Brio's innate skill to morph into a hulking brute and clear out a goal like a nightclub bouncer, resulted in a laugh-out-loud defensive strategy for us that won us many consecutive matches until we finally came upon a team that effectively countered us. It feels like there are a few reliable meta strategies in the game's early days, but nothing is foolproof that I've seen, and that is really exciting as someone living in a post-Knockout City world, looking for the next fun arcade \"sports\" game. Because team strategies can change so much in the middle of each 5-10-minute round, I witnessed some major scoring deficits be erased. A team down by over a thousand wumpas, for example, can still make a comeback if they decide to clamp down on defense, throwing all manner of blocking attacks and abilities at the enemy's goal while perhaps a single scorer accumulates wumpa slowly but surely. CTR would be dead on arrival if an early lead meant the game were already over, but that's not the case at all, provided a team knows what it's doing. All the while, an esports caster-like announcer calls a round, adding a bit of extra excitement. He doesn't say much, but when he chimes in to announce how a round is coming down to the wire or an enemy team has just called in a map's major unlock, like a UFO that chases down players relentlessly, it definitely adds to the drama. The potential for late-stage heroics and comebacks, however, does make it annoying that players can't swap characters mid-match. Whoever a player starts a round with is who they'll finish the game with, which seems like an oversight. Locking down a rival's goal with Dr. N Brio's mutant form is an early meta tactic sweeping the game. Gallery In general, the game gets its competitive elements right, while a lot of its more troubled aspects exist in the menus and the metagame. The seasonal battle pass, for example, progresses much too slowly, and many of the earned cosmetics clip through each other. Because Crash characters come in such drastically different sizes, many of the unlockable headgear options sort of float above many characters' heads. Backpacks routinely clash with character models, too, while some cosmetic categories, like character shadows, just aren't interesting enough to be sought after. On the bright side, each character has their own unlock path to level 15, with tons of challenges to complete and free cosmetics to unlock. These cosmetics aren't markedly better than what's in the battle pass, but they at least provide some added depth to the metagame while the battle pass, which in the future will be available for purchase, is too slow to enjoy. Details that might seem insignificant end up having an outsized effect on the game, like not seeing your partied-up teammates in the lobby, no one but the host knowing when matchmaking has been initiated, and odd error messages that pop up after some matches suggesting progress hasn't been saved even though it has been. There are also no daily challenges in the game currently, and the weekly challenges can't be viewed as a list. Instead, you see a new one once you've completed that which precedes it. I've reviewed other games in which a team was trying live-service elements for the first time, and these issues in CTR are reminiscent of those, where unlocking metagame rewards feels off at first because the team is still figuring them out. These elements can be tweaked, and I hope they will be. Despite all these typically telltale signs, the game is also curiously not free-to-play. While I don't review games based on their price, I will note that the $40 barrier to entry seems to have shrunken the community out of the gate. In 15 gameplay hours for this review, I faced many of the same players and teams repeatedly, suggesting the community is quite small so far, which has affected my enjoyment, as facing the same teams can become a drag and hampers the otherwise reliable element of unpredictability of any given match. I worry CTR won't receive the attention it deserves because player expectations regarding the price of a multiplayer-only game and this game's actual price are at significant odds. Crash Team Rumble demonstrates developer Toys For Bob's continued understanding of the Crash series by looking, sounding, and feeling like a Crash game even as the finer details are so new and unfamiliar for the team. The sports-like aspect of each match is delivered very well, offering more depth than initially meets the eye. A slew of strategies can result in victory, and cohesive teamplay is the fast track to success, making every victory feel earned and so much more rewarding. The game's matchmaking and metagame aspects leave a lot to be desired, but the hope is these can be fixed in time, so long as the buy-in doesn't scare away any potential for a thriving community.","length":10300,"tokens":2151,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 2:27PM PDT","content":"There are few games that serve as better examples of the industry's changing landscape than Crash Team Rumble (CTR) Once a single-player mascot platformer at the height of the genre's popularity, CTR takes the heroes and villains of Naughty Dog's, and later Activision's, series and reimagines it as a 4v4 multiplayer game with live-service elements. To some, that might sound like a myopic deathblow to a once-proud series. On the contrary, Crash Team Rumble is a fun and surprisingly tactical PvP game, albeit sometimes held back by oft-seen growing pains of games-as-a-service. In Crash Team Rumble, two teams of four square off in platforming arenas that, at first glance, each look a bit like wide levels from a typical Crash game. Enjoyably, the controls and feel of the game perfectly capture those of traditional Crash games, too, making it an instantly recognizable experience in one's hands.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 2:27PM PDT","content":"Though the game has just one mode at launch, it's designed very well. The goal is to score 2,000 wumpa fruit before the rival team does. To do this, players will spin over, slam onto, and slide into crates and loose wumpas all around the arena to collect them. Moving them to a goal area will, after a moment, score them for the team permanently. But the exciting chaos of CTR exists in this in-between space, and often even on the goals themselves. The best CTR teams are those in which every teammate knows their role and can pivot to Plan B when needed. Each team can be composed of whichever characters they see fit, which reliably results in rounds playing out differently each time. Eight characters split across three classes are available at launch: scorer, booster, and blocker. Scorers are usually faster and can carry more wumpas, thus scoring more at a time.","content_length":870,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 2:27PM PDT","content":"Blockers are very enjoyable defenders, with denial-of-area or higher damage-inflicting moves meant to constantly disrupt enemy scorers like a fly forever buzzing around their ears. Boosters are sort of the in-betweeners, meant to focus on activating multipliers and unlocking map-specific abilities, like Aku Aku masks that give the whole team a health and movement buff similar to what past Crash games had. Thresholds for unlocking these game-changing abilities are high, but work well as a result. It takes a concerted team effort to obtain them, which means a team will always have to balance chasing those powerful unlocks with scoring or playing defense. All eight players in the arena will have multiple things to focus on at all times, creating a high skill ceiling for those who use their time and space wisely. Each character can be further enhanced with unique skill unlocks that aren't limited to certain classes.","content_length":925,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 2:27PM PDT","content":"You can further enhance Crash's scoring abilities with the Wumpa Stash, giving yourself 100 or more additional wumpas over time, or you could bolster his defensive abilities by dropping a Gasmoxian Guard on the enemy's goal, thereby routinely zapping them and interrupting their scoring attempts, with the added bonus being that taking damage results in dropped wumpas. Characters having both innate and customizable abilities like these allow for further variance from round to round, as even a group of eight identical skins may across two rounds may belie a change in strategy that comes from a change in assigned cooldown skills. In my time with the game, it was easy to take the reins of a new character or ability and quickly figure them out. I definitely have favorites today in both respects, but each character's and skill's use-case is apparent, and it's really satisfying to get to grips with each of them.","content_length":917,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 2:27PM PDT","content":"A team could roll out with four people playing as Crash, a scorer, but they'd be hard-pressed to prevent the enemy team from scoring, too. Alternatively, a team could bulk up on defenders like N. Tropy and Dingodile, but they'd be at risk of scoring too slowly. The game allows players to create their own team comps, which definitely can result in some lopsided matches. However, in my experience, some seemingly deficient team comps still led to victory when the team played cohesively. Voice comms feel more necessary in Crash than in many other PvP games, and as a result of that, I took to mostly playing with my squad of four, enjoying it less when jumping in with random players.

For the first time in a long while, a promotion emerged which could rival the longtime king of American pro wrestling, WWE. There have undeniably been some growing pains, but four years later, AEW continues to be a popular alternative option for wrestling fans. Now, the company is trying to do the same in the video game world with AEW: Fight Forever, and much like those first AEW shows, the game is a promising debut effort--but with some noticeable room for improvement. Fight Forever features 47 wrestlers--a far cry from the 218 wrestlers in WWE 2K23, for comparison--at the start, with more able to be unlocked via the in-game shop with currency earned through playing the game. AEW mainstays like MJF, Kenny Omega, Jon Moxley, Dr. Britt Baker D. M. D., \"Hangman\" Adam Page, and The Young Bucks are here, as well as a few surprising entries. Some of them are heartwarming tributes to wrestlers who have passed away--like Mr. Brodie Lee and Owen Hart--while others are names who have departed to the competition like Cody Rhodes. There are plenty of names missing--the current AEW Women's Champion Toni Storm, the previous women's champion Jamie Hayter, and two-thirds of the Trios Champion House Of Black, for example--but it does represent most of the top talent currently in the promotion. What's cool about Fight Forever's approach to the roster is that everyone is on an even playing field. There are no ratings in Fight Forever; I can pick any matchup I want and have the same chance of winning no matter who I'm controlling. And I do mean \"any matchup I want,\" as intergender matches--which aren't available in WWE's current game series--are completely fine here. The game treats its roster less like a wrestling simulation, with clear divisions and ratings that separate the big stars from the midcard talent, and more like a fighting game where anyone can fight anyone, no questions asked. Being able to book whoever I want in a match, regardless of gender, size, or any other factors, is a really cool approach and I love that Fight Forever opted for it. The game's mechanics are simple and approachable--adopting a scheme that channels WWF No Mercy from the Nintendo 64 days--which gives even more weight to the \"everyone is even\" roster approach. Moving around the ring is easy, attacking with strikes, grapples, and special moves feels comfortable in my hands. There will be an adjustment period for those accustomed to newer wrestling games, though, as some actions aren't as responsive as others. Running easily requires the most practice, as it's slow to start up and then requires the wrestler to run in a single direction. The game does a good job of teaching the basics, however, both through tips that pop up during a match and through the training mode. The tip screens are accompanied by voiceovers from notable AEW personalities, though some of the voices sound like they're reading from a script rather than trying to train a wrestler. I particularly like how executing a finishing move is the same input as taunting, since taunting with a signature move available is how I access the finishing move to begin with. I don't have to worry about multiple button presses to pull off my favorite moves, it's one simple motion. Therefore, a quick flick of the right stick to taunt, followed by another quick flick of the same stick when my opponent is in range, and I'm hitting my most powerful move. I love how easy that feels. I can also add to the roster myself through the game's wrestler creation suite, which on the surface seems limited but ends up being surprisingly robust. The physical customization options are fine but noticeably limited, with the amount of attires, hair options, and other elements available being mostly generic apparel or wrestler-focused offerings. Creating a moveset is much more in-depth, as it offers plenty of moves for a variety of different situations and lets me create the perfect moveset for me. Getting through the list, however, is a challenge, as there's no organization in how the moves are listed. Alphabetizing each list would have gone a long way in making customization even more streamlined than it already is. That said, though it may seem limited compared to other games' offerings, it never feels too overwhelming, and what might take me an hour elsewhere I was able to make work in about 20 minutes here even with the menu issues. Fans of pro wrestling know that one of the most important aspects of an event is the wrestler entrances, and I found myself disappointed with what Fight Forever offered in that regard. Instead of full walks to the ring with all of the pomp and circumstance of a Wednesday night on AEW Dynamite, each wrestler gets about 10 seconds of their entrance shown before the game moves on, much like an updated version of WWF No Mercy on the Nintendo 64. While other wrestling games let you skip entrances to get to the action faster, it feels like that choice is taken away from those of us who want to watch them in full. There is an attempt to mitigate this, as I'm allowed to add my own pyrotechnics and lighting effects by pressing buttons, but while that's fun, I can barely see anything I'm adding to each entrance, so I don't understand why they were added in the first place. What's more, customizing my own entrance for a created character only twists that knife further; I want to see my creation in all their glory, but it's just not available.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158405-4. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4158405-4. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158405-4. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4158405-4. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The variety of matches is unfortunately just as lacking as the roster, as there are some popular match types missing. Standard match types such as one-on-one singles, two-on-two tag, and three- and four-way matches are all here, along with some specialty matches including ladder matches, \"lights out\" matches (basically \"anything goes'' matches with weapons), and two AEW trademarks: The Casino Battle Royale and the Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch. All of these can also be played online in ranked and casual matches, which is a major plus. One notable omission is three-on-three trios matches, especially considering AEW has a Trios Championship title, but as the game only supports a maximum of four wrestlers in the ring at one time, trios by its nature had to be left out. However, there's also one extra addition: minigames, a selection of small, Mario Party-style games which are unlike anything I've ever seen in a wrestling video game before. Trivia contests, coin collecting while wrestling, and more are available, and they're all silly fun which serve as a nice break between matches. The Casino Battle Royale here in Fight Forever is an interesting spin on the real-world version, one which takes into account the technical limitations of the game only supporting four wrestlers in the ring at one time. In the real version, wrestlers are assigned \"suits\" and they all come out when that suit is called--club, spade, heart, and diamond. Here, you are still assigned a suit, but now one wrestler of each suit comes out at a time, and should they be eliminated, the next wrestler in that group comes out. This makes the match feel like a Team Battle mode in a fighting game rather than a battle royale, which some might argue goes against the spirit of the match, but as a technical workaround it's a novel approach that works for me.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch, meanwhile, is presented as advertised: Barbed wire lines the ring ropes, and if I can force my opponent into them, fireworks explode and the poor wrestler on the receiving end takes massive damage. There's also a running timer where, after two minutes elapse, a massive explosion rocks both wrestlers in the match and acts as a \"reset\" of sorts. Playing this match is a ton of fun, with the explosions and blood marking the canvas giving it an extra edge from other match types--and thankfully blood can be turned off for the more squeamish players. The Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch in game is, ironically, much better than the one AEW actually put on in 2021. The last main offering is Road To Elite, which is a story mode played with either a created character or an existing member of the roster. The mode is broken up into four sections, with each section containing four weeks of action set in a different real-world city. The first three weeks end with an episode of Dynamite, while the fourth week ends with one of AEW's pay-per-view events. Each week, I can choose between multiple activities--working out, dining, or \"going out\"--with each one giving me a buff to my statistics. I'm allowed four of these activities before going to that week's match, and a small cutscene plays based on whichever I choose. These cutscenes range from routine weightlifting to goofy conversations with other wrestlers which result in pictures being taken in front of a famous landmark in whichever city I'm in. These cutscenes are the best part of the mode, as I never knew what to expect whenever I'd pick one of the activities. In one moment I could be signing autographs and telling fans about the hard life of a wrestler, in another I'm posing in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia with Jon Moxley, and in another I'm eating a Juicy Lucy--a burger with the cheese baked in--from a restaurant called Grub Informer in Minneapolis. The dialogue in the scenes is just as goofy, as it borders between laugh-out-loud funny and cringeworthy, but I'm happy to say I laughed more than I cringed. There's barely any interaction in these scenes outside of moving the dialogue along, but they're still a lot of fun to watch. Better still, Road To Elite offers four different stories for each of the four-week sections, which means that in my second run through the mode, I saw completely different stories with completely different cutscenes and photo ops. There are 256 photo opportunities in all, in fact, which gives the mode plenty of replayability. However, the storylines don't always match up properly, which creates some strange situations. For example, in a run with Malakai Black, I ended up winning the AEW Championship at All Out--the first pay-per-view on the docket. Amazingly, I was never pictured with the title belt again, as if that win never happened. I found that odd, as I had assumed the storylines after winning the title would be defending it, but that opportunity never came. The stories that did play out were still fun, but what happened to my championship?AEW Fight Forever, much like the company it represents, is a cocky young upstart trying to take the crown from a titan. Also much like its source material, its first outing is a decent foundation for what its future could provide. The roster is a good primer on the current AEW lineup, there are enough match types to keep things fresh for a while, and Road To Elite is an irreverent look at the life of a wrestler that made me smile. There are some bumps in this road--particularly the lack of trios matches and the disappointing entrances--but those are all things which can be fixed in future installments. If AEW truly plans to Fight Forever in the video game world, then they've thrown an effective first punch.","length":12110,"tokens":2715,"chunks":[{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"In 2019, All Elite Wrestling opened its doors and immediately changed the professional wrestling world.

Some of them are heartwarming tributes to wrestlers who have passed away--like Mr. Brodie Lee and Owen Hart--while others are names who have departed to the competition like Cody Rhodes. There are plenty of names missing--the current AEW Women's Champion Toni Storm, the previous women's champion Jamie Hayter, and two-thirds of the Trios Champion House Of Black, for example--but it does represent most of the top talent currently in the promotion. What's cool about Fight Forever's approach to the roster is that everyone is on an even playing field. There are no ratings in Fight Forever; I can pick any matchup I want and have the same chance of winning no matter who I'm controlling.","content_length":780,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"And I do mean \"any matchup I want,\" as intergender matches--which aren't available in WWE's current game series--are completely fine here. The game treats its roster less like a wrestling simulation, with clear divisions and ratings that separate the big stars from the midcard talent, and more like a fighting game where anyone can fight anyone, no questions asked. Being able to book whoever I want in a match, regardless of gender, size, or any other factors, is a really cool approach and I love that Fight Forever opted for it. The game's mechanics are simple and approachable--adopting a scheme that channels WWF No Mercy from the Nintendo 64 days--which gives even more weight to the \"everyone is even\" roster approach. Moving around the ring is easy, attacking with strikes, grapples, and special moves feels comfortable in my hands.","content_length":841,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"There will be an adjustment period for those accustomed to newer wrestling games, though, as some actions aren't as responsive as others. Running easily requires the most practice, as it's slow to start up and then requires the wrestler to run in a single direction. The game does a good job of teaching the basics, however, both through tips that pop up during a match and through the training mode. The tip screens are accompanied by voiceovers from notable AEW personalities, though some of the voices sound like they're reading from a script rather than trying to train a wrestler. I particularly like how executing a finishing move is the same input as taunting, since taunting with a signature move available is how I access the finishing move to begin with. I don't have to worry about multiple button presses to pull off my favorite moves, it's one simple motion.","content_length":871,"content_tokens":173,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"Therefore, a quick flick of the right stick to taunt, followed by another quick flick of the same stick when my opponent is in range, and I'm hitting my most powerful move. I love how easy that feels. I can also add to the roster myself through the game's wrestler creation suite, which on the surface seems limited but ends up being surprisingly robust. The physical customization options are fine but noticeably limited, with the amount of attires, hair options, and other elements available being mostly generic apparel or wrestler-focused offerings. Creating a moveset is much more in-depth, as it offers plenty of moves for a variety of different situations and lets me create the perfect moveset for me. Getting through the list, however, is a challenge, as there's no organization in how the moves are listed. Alphabetizing each list would have gone a long way in making customization even more streamlined than it already is.","content_length":933,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"That said, though it may seem limited compared to other games' offerings, it never feels too overwhelming, and what might take me an hour elsewhere I was able to make work in about 20 minutes here even with the menu issues. Fans of pro wrestling know that one of the most important aspects of an event is the wrestler entrances, and I found myself disappointed with what Fight Forever offered in that regard. Instead of full walks to the ring with all of the pomp and circumstance of a Wednesday night on AEW Dynamite, each wrestler gets about 10 seconds of their entrance shown before the game moves on, much like an updated version of WWF No Mercy on the Nintendo 64. While other wrestling games let you skip entrances to get to the action faster, it feels like that choice is taken away from those of us who want to watch them in full.","content_length":838,"content_tokens":169,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"There is an attempt to mitigate this, as I'm allowed to add my own pyrotechnics and lighting effects by pressing buttons, but while that's fun, I can barely see anything I'm adding to each entrance, so I don't understand why they were added in the first place.

One notable omission is three-on-three trios matches, especially considering AEW has a Trios Championship title, but as the game only supports a maximum of four wrestlers in the ring at one time, trios by its nature had to be left out. However, there's also one extra addition: minigames, a selection of small, Mario Party-style games which are unlike anything I've ever seen in a wrestling video game before. Trivia contests, coin collecting while wrestling, and more are available, and they're all silly fun which serve as a nice break between matches. The Casino Battle Royale here in Fight Forever is an interesting spin on the real-world version, one which takes into account the technical limitations of the game only supporting four wrestlers in the ring at one time.","content_length":866,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"In the real version, wrestlers are assigned \"suits\" and they all come out when that suit is called--club, spade, heart, and diamond. Here, you are still assigned a suit, but now one wrestler of each suit comes out at a time, and should they be eliminated, the next wrestler in that group comes out. This makes the match feel like a Team Battle mode in a fighting game rather than a battle royale, which some might argue goes against the spirit of the match, but as a technical workaround it's a novel approach that works for me.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 1920w, https://www.","content_length":745,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4158408-5. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch, meanwhile, is presented as advertised: Barbed wire lines the ring ropes, and if I can force my opponent into them, fireworks explode and the poor wrestler on the receiving end takes massive damage.

The Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch in game is, ironically, much better than the one AEW actually put on in 2021. The last main offering is Road To Elite, which is a story mode played with either a created character or an existing member of the roster. The mode is broken up into four sections, with each section containing four weeks of action set in a different real-world city. The first three weeks end with an episode of Dynamite, while the fourth week ends with one of AEW's pay-per-view events. Each week, I can choose between multiple activities--working out, dining, or \"going out\"--with each one giving me a buff to my statistics.","content_length":845,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"I'm allowed four of these activities before going to that week's match, and a small cutscene plays based on whichever I choose. These cutscenes range from routine weightlifting to goofy conversations with other wrestlers which result in pictures being taken in front of a famous landmark in whichever city I'm in. These cutscenes are the best part of the mode, as I never knew what to expect whenever I'd pick one of the activities. In one moment I could be signing autographs and telling fans about the hard life of a wrestler, in another I'm posing in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia with Jon Moxley, and in another I'm eating a Juicy Lucy--a burger with the cheese baked in--from a restaurant called Grub Informer in Minneapolis. The dialogue in the scenes is just as goofy, as it borders between laugh-out-loud funny and cringeworthy, but I'm happy to say I laughed more than I cringed.","content_length":900,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"There's barely any interaction in these scenes outside of moving the dialogue along, but they're still a lot of fun to watch. Better still, Road To Elite offers four different stories for each of the four-week sections, which means that in my second run through the mode, I saw completely different stories with completely different cutscenes and photo ops. There are 256 photo opportunities in all, in fact, which gives the mode plenty of replayability. However, the storylines don't always match up properly, which creates some strange situations. For example, in a run with Malakai Black, I ended up winning the AEW Championship at All Out--the first pay-per-view on the docket. Amazingly, I was never pictured with the title belt again, as if that win never happened. I found that odd, as I had assumed the storylines after winning the title would be defending it, but that opportunity never came.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"AEW: Fight Forever Review - A Midcard Debut","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/","post_date":"June 28, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"The stories that did play out were still fun, but what happened to my championship?AEW Fight Forever, much like the company it represents, is a cocky young upstart trying to take the crown from a titan. Also much like its source material, its first outing is a decent foundation for what its future could provide. The roster is a good primer on the current AEW lineup, there are enough match types to keep things fresh for a while, and Road To Elite is an irreverent look at the life of a wrestler that made me smile. There are some bumps in this road--particularly the lack of trios matches and the disappointing entrances--but those are all things which can be fixed in future installments.

It's not just in the graphic depictions of bloody battles or godlike beings crushing each other to a pulp, but also in the explicit narrative threads about persecution and enslavement. It delves into the death and destruction that follows in the wake of all the political drama and supernatural standoffs. The brutality inflicted upon its victims is laid bare at nearly every turn, sometimes to the point of embellishment, to strike the nerves it wants to hit. But there's a thematic coherence to it all that melds what happens to the people at the ground level with the fantastical elements that steer their destinies. And within that harsh exterior, glossed with magic and aether, is a gripping story about characters clinging to their humanity, the bonds that give them strength, and the lengths they'll go to make the world a better place--all told in a way that only Final Fantasy can. Final Fantasy has always been about reinvention and FFXVI perhaps marks the series' most drastic shift yet. The combat system veers much closer to a Devil May Cry than Final Fantasy XV or VII Remake, and is a shining example of what an action-RPG can be. Eikon battles initially seem to be just explosive set-pieces but grow into meaningful moments that are as narratively driven as they are utterly impressive spectacles. Through the awe-inspiring battles and emotional cutscenes, I found myself repeatedly asking in disbelief, \"Did this game just do this?\" as the soundtrack's beautiful melodies were seared into my memory. However, those peaks are also met with dated design conventions that stick out like sore thumbs, making for some noticeable lulls in the 50-plus hours I spent with the game. Still, I’ll always remember FFXVI for its powerful and stunning moments, for those are the reasons it stands among the storied franchise's best. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Valisthea is a world plagued by environmental decay and war is fueled by the hunger for resources, which in this case, are the crystals. Because they are a catch-all magical resource, those with the inherent ability to wield magic are abused, subjugated, and treated as property; tools to be used and sacrificed in service of their supposed superiors. Thus, liberation and revolution are the narrative throughlines, and FFXVI heavily leans into these themes, using them as a strong foundation to build every facet of the story and its characters. FFXVI mostly navigates these themes with a deft hand. Its writing often demonstrates an understanding of the complex dynamics that come with the territory, and it shines by empowering characters, letting them and their experiences be the focal points in sharp cutscenes and dialogue. As heinous as the darkest moments may be, they're also crucial to each character's understanding of the hostile world they exist in. It's encouraging to see the game plainly say what needs to be said, though at times that deft hand turns heavy, laying it on a little too thick or overlooking a bit of nuance that could've gone a long way in properly unpacking a theme or perspective. On rare occasions, I found a few minor story events that undermined the rather clear messages the game tries to send. But as a core motivation for the cast, and me as the player, to take action remains convincing throughout, and this results in some great narrative payoffs. Jill is a fantastic character who fights alongside Clive and plays a significant role. Clive and his brother Joshua are caught up in all this because they belong to a royal family that inherits the power of Phoenix, one of the Eikons that shake up the power balance within Valisthea. Tragedy strikes their family early on, setting the story in motion and establishing just how important Dominants--the select few who can tap and transform into Eikons--are as weapons of mass destruction. It seems like a blessing, but it's very much a curse, and the earth-shaking power they wield comes with clear consequences. This blending of political drama, social injustice, and the fantastical tropes of Final Fantasy gives the story room to have the mythical bombast expected of the series but also make it meaningful. The Eikons are a great reimagining of Final Fantasy's summons, and they're smartly contextualized within the story--so for as bonkers and over-the-top as Eikons can be, FFXVI's story always finds itself landing on solid ground. Embedded in the themes of rebellion and the displays of godlike power are strong personal stories of revenge and redemption. The burden of sins, things they've done that they're not wholly responsible for, weigh heavy on the main cast's shoulders. I've grown quite tired of the old trope that seeking revenge is an empty endeavor that makes you as bad as your oppressors, so it's invigorating to have a story put its foot down and give characters the satisfaction of killing their masters to set themselves free, presented without caveat. Nevertheless, atonement is yet another important lens through which you see characters develop and go through the process of re-distinguishing what's right and wrong. Sometimes this means forgoing their privileges, making immeasurable sacrifices, or defying their supposed fate. For all its dark turns, FFXVI is very much a story about love and the various forms it can take. It's a beautiful, honest tale of brotherhood; there's a familial love that I sometimes find hard to relate to, but in this regard, FFXVI cuts sharper than any story I've experienced in recent memory. There are also a few romantic plot lines that flow naturally into what motivates particular characters, and deep friendships that form through shared experiences. And good boy Torgal is the loyal dog who fights with Clive every step of the way. It wouldn't be a Final Fantasy without the power of human bonds manifesting as the strength to carry on and giving its characters a world worth fighting for. Clive and Joshua exemplify a strong brotherly love wonderfully shown in FFXVI's story. These more granular themes work so well because whether it's Clive, Joshua, Cid, Jill or any of the other key characters, their personalities are driven by inspired voice performances. Clive is often the gruff guy who doesn't have much to be happy about, but this makes the moments he breaks out of his shell all the more impactful. When he screams and cries in desperation, it's the sound of someone truly in pain and you feel it in your bones, and when he cracks a smile or lets loose, it's a moment to rejoice. It certainly makes him one of the realest protagonists in the Final Fantasy pantheon. Cid shakes the room with the sheer bass in his voice, and his smooth charisma and sharp wits steal every scene. He's the kind of person that can make even the most aimless people believe in a cause, and the most stone-hearted people bare their souls. A believable human quality draws you toward Jill, so when she pours her heart out or has blood in her eyes, you know she means it. And when each of them rises to the occasion in their most critical moments, you can damn well hear it in their delivery. FFXVI goes for some big swings, and hits when it matters most. It's a tightly woven and focused story told without sacrificing the magic that makes Final Fantasy special. It takes a while to see it come together, and stumbles into a few disappointing tropes along the way. But at its peak, whether it be the sheer thrill of the action or the raw emotional honesty--and sometimes the harmony between the two--FFXVI goes so hard that I could feel it in my heart. A significant part of what had me so invested in FFXVI is the stylish-action combat since it's so tightly tied to the game's identity. While you only control Clive throughout the game, his roster of Eikon abilities build up alongside story events, and the framing of his greatest battles works so well because he controls like a nimble, masterful swordsman with a slew of badass powers he can whip out and string together at any moment.<img alt=\"I play FFXIV, these AoEs don't phase me.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155665-finalfantasyxvi_20230613171646. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155665-finalfantasyxvi_20230613171646. jpg 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155665-finalfantasyxvi_20230613171646. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155665-finalfantasyxvi_20230613171646. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">I play FFXIV, these AoEs don't phase me. FFXVI loosely retains the design principles of an RPG, with skill trees, a leveling system, upgradable gear, and stats that create a sense of progression. But when you're in combat, your handling of Clive's technical capabilities and Eikon powers are what'll win the battle. You can equip three Eikons and swap between them on the fly in battle--each has two powers on cooldown and a unique utility move that you can execute at any time. Customizing and mapping out your Eikon abilities is key; to be approached as if you're creating loadouts or team compositions in other games. And because these abilities all have properties such as launching, midair execution, charge-ups, or area-of-effect damage, you can get creative with some sweet combos. For example, I often used a bread-and-butter rotation starting with Phoenix's Rising Flames then going into Garuda's Wicked Wheel, launching myself midair before smashing down with Titan's Upheaval and finishing off with a full-powered Windup before mixing in the standard sword-slashing combo. If you just want cool-looking abilities that do tons of damage, you can get away with that, too. But the more you inspect the nuances of how certain abilities can be strung together, the more you'll see the ways you can execute deliberate attack rotations. Brilliantly designed boss battles bring out the best in the stylish-action combat. Typically, you work to bring down their stagger meter then hit them with all you've got, carefully planning your attack sequence to make the most of the damage multiplier that goes into effect in a staggered state, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake. But these bosses also challenge your skills in dodging, positioning, reading incoming attacks, and reacting with precision and swiftness. As someone who has a couple thousand hours in Final Fantasy XIV and regularly does savage raids, I can clearly see how the MMORPG's boss mechanics have influenced FFXVI. It's one of the development team's many strengths and I'm thrilled to see those design philosophies cross over to enrich the experience.<img alt=\"Nothing more satisfying than laying on the stagger damage on a beefy foe.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155666-vlcscreenshot2023-06-21-02h34m44s129. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155666-vlcscreenshot2023-06-21-02h34m44s129. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155666-vlcscreenshot2023-06-21-02h34m44s129. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155666-vlcscreenshot2023-06-21-02h34m44s129. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Nothing more satisfying than laying on the stagger damage on a beefy foe. Because the accumulation of Eikon abilities is beholden to story progress, it takes time for the deeper gameplay elements to open up. While it strengthens the narrative coherence with the gameplay, it creates somewhat odd pacing in the first half of the game, and it's a bit disappointing because later Eikon abilities offer some fascinating possibilities and add layers of depth. FFXVI isn't a particularly difficult game, but sometimes you'll run into DPS checks or encounter enemy attacks that do significant damage in one hit, which you can sometimes brute force your way through by popping potions. There is challenge in the purely gameplay-focused Arcade Mode--which ranks you like a Devil May Cry game--and the New Game+ Ultimania difficulty, which cranks the challenge to near-impossible heights, for those who want it. Other than sheer enjoyment of besting the game's toughest battles, engaging with these modes is mostly for leaderboard bragging rights. On the flipside, there are accessories that act as gameplay assists that can help those who may struggle with various aspects of the combat system--options such as auto-combos or more lenient dodge timing don't completely automate the experience, though there are accessories that can do that for you. However you choose to play, it's certainly satisfying to best the most imposing monsters while receiving hardly a scratch with every Eikon ability exhausted. FFXVI isn't a complex game either, as its structure is pretty straightforward. You have a home base called The Hideaway and sparsely populated hub areas for each region that gradually open up as you make progress and sidequests populate these areas to flesh out the world. Once you get access to the Hunt Board, you'll find optional boss fights within these regions that reward you with a satisfying challenge, a bunch of XP, and materials for better gear. But the main quest is primarily driven by distinct combat-focused scenarios akin to a linear dungeon where mobs of enemies are interspersed with a handful of boss fights. Not only do these contain some of the best story moments and cinematics, it's where gameplay finds its groove, hitting an enjoyable cadence of spectacular fights.<img alt=\"I can't wait for folks to meet Mid because she absolutely rules.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">I can't wait for folks to meet Mid because she absolutely rules. Sidequests are, unfortunately, one of FFXVI's weaker parts. Having done all of them, I feel they're still worth doing for the way they humanize the people of Valisthea. I would go as far to say that a handful of them are critical for getting the full picture of key characters and their relationships. But outside of those few important ones that reward you with heartfelt scenes, they're mostly comprised of stilted dialogue sequences with objectives that rarely make the most of the game's strengths. It's where the writing occasionally falls flat, too, so the contrast in quality is stark when the main quest has best-in-class storytelling. Where FFXVI flexes the hardest, though, is in the Eikon-versus-Eikon battles: pivotal moments where fully transformed Dominants put everything on the line and fight with everything they got. There aren't many of these boss fights, but the ones from around the halfway point up until the end make for some of the wildest, most impressive spectacles seen in video games. New powers specific to these battles open up as the game goes on, too, so it's not all quick time events or glorified button mashing. And even when they do rely on QTEs, you get a ridiculous display of strength that would make Asura's Wrath proud. I'm not easily wooed by fancy cinematics or super-high visual fidelity, but FFXVI is one case where that technical prowess accentuates the grand scale of these genuinely surprising, astonishing moments.<img alt=\"Cid is just that dude.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Cid is just that dude. Whether it's in heated battles, emotional cutscenes, or brief treks across Valisthea, it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game without an evocative soundtrack to match. Composer Masayoshi Soken and his team are a significant part of what makes FFXIV a special MMORPG experience, and their work on FFXVI further proves that the series' music is in good hands. Reverberating piano pieces instill a tranquil and wistful vibe set against the vast landscapes, much like overworld themes heard in FFXIV. The commanding orchestras and choirs bring an undeniable weight to crucial battles. But, as Soken often does, he breaks from thematic conventions to add electronic tunes and heavy guitars that somehow fit right in. Even the normal boss theme had me sitting up straight, shoulders squared, humming along as I whooped on my foes with confidence. And the identifiable melodies that become powerful leitmotifs capture feelings that are tough to put into words: beautiful expressions of the complex emotions that the characters, and me as the player, feel in particular moments. Music is integral to the storytelling in Final Fantasy and FFXVI is a masterful execution of this pillar of the series' tradition. When I hear the new renditions of the Crystal Prelude and the original Final Fantasy theme, I look back at the franchise's rich history and realize just how much of an impact it's made on me and countless others. There are eras of my life that have been defined by Final Fantasy games and my connection to them. Having seen FFXVI all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series. It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms.","length":20496,"tokens":4827,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"Upon first impression, Final Fantasy XVI struck me with its darker and more violent tone than anything in the series' past. It's not just in the graphic depictions of bloody battles or godlike beings crushing each other to a pulp, but also in the explicit narrative threads about persecution and enslavement. It delves into the death and destruction that follows in the wake of all the political drama and supernatural standoffs. The brutality inflicted upon its victims is laid bare at nearly every turn, sometimes to the point of embellishment, to strike the nerves it wants to hit. But there's a thematic coherence to it all that melds what happens to the people at the ground level with the fantastical elements that steer their destinies.","content_length":743,"content_tokens":149,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"And within that harsh exterior, glossed with magic and aether, is a gripping story about characters clinging to their humanity, the bonds that give them strength, and the lengths they'll go to make the world a better place--all told in a way that only Final Fantasy can. Final Fantasy has always been about reinvention and FFXVI perhaps marks the series' most drastic shift yet. The combat system veers much closer to a Devil May Cry than Final Fantasy XV or VII Remake, and is a shining example of what an action-RPG can be. Eikon battles initially seem to be just explosive set-pieces but grow into meaningful moments that are as narratively driven as they are utterly impressive spectacles. Through the awe-inspiring battles and emotional cutscenes, I found myself repeatedly asking in disbelief, \"Did this game just do this?\" as the soundtrack's beautiful melodies were seared into my memory. However, those peaks are also met with dated design conventions that stick out like sore thumbs, making for some noticeable lulls in the 50-plus hours I spent with the game. Still, I’ll always remember FFXVI for its powerful and stunning moments, for those are the reasons it stands among the storied franchise's best.","content_length":1214,"content_tokens":256,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute Firearms Expert Reacts To Counter-Strike 2’s GunsLords of the Fallen - 11 Things I Wish I KnewActivision Blizzard King Joins Xbox - Official TrailerTransformers: Earthspark - Expedition - Launch TrailerMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Everything To KnowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III - Official PC Features TrailerLords of the Fallen Video ReviewApex Legends - Doppelgangers Collection Event TrailerTattoo Historian Reacts To Tattoos In GamesEarth Defense Force 6 - Official Announcement TrailerDevil May Cry: Peak Of Combat | VERGIL Character Gameplay Reveal TrailerDRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 - Festival of Universes Trailer ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Because they are a catch-all magical resource, those with the inherent ability to wield magic are abused, subjugated, and treated as property; tools to be used and sacrificed in service of their supposed superiors. Thus, liberation and revolution are the narrative throughlines, and FFXVI heavily leans into these themes, using them as a strong foundation to build every facet of the story and its characters. FFXVI mostly navigates these themes with a deft hand. Its writing often demonstrates an understanding of the complex dynamics that come with the territory, and it shines by empowering characters, letting them and their experiences be the focal points in sharp cutscenes and dialogue. As heinous as the darkest moments may be, they're also crucial to each character's understanding of the hostile world they exist in.","content_length":963,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"It's encouraging to see the game plainly say what needs to be said, though at times that deft hand turns heavy, laying it on a little too thick or overlooking a bit of nuance that could've gone a long way in properly unpacking a theme or perspective. On rare occasions, I found a few minor story events that undermined the rather clear messages the game tries to send. But as a core motivation for the cast, and me as the player, to take action remains convincing throughout, and this results in some great narrative payoffs. Jill is a fantastic character who fights alongside Clive and plays a significant role. Clive and his brother Joshua are caught up in all this because they belong to a royal family that inherits the power of Phoenix, one of the Eikons that shake up the power balance within Valisthea.","content_length":809,"content_tokens":166,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"Tragedy strikes their family early on, setting the story in motion and establishing just how important Dominants--the select few who can tap and transform into Eikons--are as weapons of mass destruction. It seems like a blessing, but it's very much a curse, and the earth-shaking power they wield comes with clear consequences. This blending of political drama, social injustice, and the fantastical tropes of Final Fantasy gives the story room to have the mythical bombast expected of the series but also make it meaningful. The Eikons are a great reimagining of Final Fantasy's summons, and they're smartly contextualized within the story--so for as bonkers and over-the-top as Eikons can be, FFXVI's story always finds itself landing on solid ground. Embedded in the themes of rebellion and the displays of godlike power are strong personal stories of revenge and redemption.","content_length":878,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"The burden of sins, things they've done that they're not wholly responsible for, weigh heavy on the main cast's shoulders. I've grown quite tired of the old trope that seeking revenge is an empty endeavor that makes you as bad as your oppressors, so it's invigorating to have a story put its foot down and give characters the satisfaction of killing their masters to set themselves free, presented without caveat. Nevertheless, atonement is yet another important lens through which you see characters develop and go through the process of re-distinguishing what's right and wrong. Sometimes this means forgoing their privileges, making immeasurable sacrifices, or defying their supposed fate. For all its dark turns, FFXVI is very much a story about love and the various forms it can take.","content_length":789,"content_tokens":162,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"It's a beautiful, honest tale of brotherhood; there's a familial love that I sometimes find hard to relate to, but in this regard, FFXVI cuts sharper than any story I've experienced in recent memory. There are also a few romantic plot lines that flow naturally into what motivates particular characters, and deep friendships that form through shared experiences. And good boy Torgal is the loyal dog who fights with Clive every step of the way. It wouldn't be a Final Fantasy without the power of human bonds manifesting as the strength to carry on and giving its characters a world worth fighting for. Clive and Joshua exemplify a strong brotherly love wonderfully shown in FFXVI's story.

It certainly makes him one of the realest protagonists in the Final Fantasy pantheon. Cid shakes the room with the sheer bass in his voice, and his smooth charisma and sharp wits steal every scene. He's the kind of person that can make even the most aimless people believe in a cause, and the most stone-hearted people bare their souls.

And because these abilities all have properties such as launching, midair execution, charge-ups, or area-of-effect damage, you can get creative with some sweet combos. For example, I often used a bread-and-butter rotation starting with Phoenix's Rising Flames then going into Garuda's Wicked Wheel, launching myself midair before smashing down with Titan's Upheaval and finishing off with a full-powered Windup before mixing in the standard sword-slashing combo.

But these bosses also challenge your skills in dodging, positioning, reading incoming attacks, and reacting with precision and swiftness.

While it strengthens the narrative coherence with the gameplay, it creates somewhat odd pacing in the first half of the game, and it's a bit disappointing because later Eikon abilities offer some fascinating possibilities and add layers of depth.","content_length":645,"content_tokens":168,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"FFXVI isn't a particularly difficult game, but sometimes you'll run into DPS checks or encounter enemy attacks that do significant damage in one hit, which you can sometimes brute force your way through by popping potions. There is challenge in the purely gameplay-focused Arcade Mode--which ranks you like a Devil May Cry game--and the New Game+ Ultimania difficulty, which cranks the challenge to near-impossible heights, for those who want it. Other than sheer enjoyment of besting the game's toughest battles, engaging with these modes is mostly for leaderboard bragging rights. On the flipside, there are accessories that act as gameplay assists that can help those who may struggle with various aspects of the combat system--options such as auto-combos or more lenient dodge timing don't completely automate the experience, though there are accessories that can do that for you.","content_length":884,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"However you choose to play, it's certainly satisfying to best the most imposing monsters while receiving hardly a scratch with every Eikon ability exhausted. FFXVI isn't a complex game either, as its structure is pretty straightforward. You have a home base called The Hideaway and sparsely populated hub areas for each region that gradually open up as you make progress and sidequests populate these areas to flesh out the world. Once you get access to the Hunt Board, you'll find optional boss fights within these regions that reward you with a satisfying challenge, a bunch of XP, and materials for better gear. But the main quest is primarily driven by distinct combat-focused scenarios akin to a linear dungeon where mobs of enemies are interspersed with a handful of boss fights.","content_length":785,"content_tokens":155,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"Not only do these contain some of the best story moments and cinematics, it's where gameplay finds its groove, hitting an enjoyable cadence of spectacular fights.<img alt=\"I can't wait for folks to meet Mid because she absolutely rules.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot.","content_length":606,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155677-finalfantasyxvi_20230616022437. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">I can't wait for folks to meet Mid because she absolutely rules. Sidequests are, unfortunately, one of FFXVI's weaker parts. Having done all of them, I feel they're still worth doing for the way they humanize the people of Valisthea. I would go as far to say that a handful of them are critical for getting the full picture of key characters and their relationships. But outside of those few important ones that reward you with heartfelt scenes, they're mostly comprised of stilted dialogue sequences with objectives that rarely make the most of the game's strengths.","content_length":718,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"It's where the writing occasionally falls flat, too, so the contrast in quality is stark when the main quest has best-in-class storytelling. Where FFXVI flexes the hardest, though, is in the Eikon-versus-Eikon battles: pivotal moments where fully transformed Dominants put everything on the line and fight with everything they got. There aren't many of these boss fights, but the ones from around the halfway point up until the end make for some of the wildest, most impressive spectacles seen in video games. New powers specific to these battles open up as the game goes on, too, so it's not all quick time events or glorified button mashing. And even when they do rely on QTEs, you get a ridiculous display of strength that would make Asura's Wrath proud.","content_length":757,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"I'm not easily wooed by fancy cinematics or super-high visual fidelity, but FFXVI is one case where that technical prowess accentuates the grand scale of these genuinely surprising, astonishing moments.<img alt=\"Cid is just that dude.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot.","content_length":604,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4155668-finalfantasyxvi_20230605013038. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Cid is just that dude. Whether it's in heated battles, emotional cutscenes, or brief treks across Valisthea, it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game without an evocative soundtrack to match. Composer Masayoshi Soken and his team are a significant part of what makes FFXIV a special MMORPG experience, and their work on FFXVI further proves that the series' music is in good hands. Reverberating piano pieces instill a tranquil and wistful vibe set against the vast landscapes, much like overworld themes heard in FFXIV. The commanding orchestras and choirs bring an undeniable weight to crucial battles.","content_length":750,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"But, as Soken often does, he breaks from thematic conventions to add electronic tunes and heavy guitars that somehow fit right in. Even the normal boss theme had me sitting up straight, shoulders squared, humming along as I whooped on my foes with confidence. And the identifiable melodies that become powerful leitmotifs capture feelings that are tough to put into words: beautiful expressions of the complex emotions that the characters, and me as the player, feel in particular moments. Music is integral to the storytelling in Final Fantasy and FFXVI is a masterful execution of this pillar of the series' tradition. When I hear the new renditions of the Crystal Prelude and the original Final Fantasy theme, I look back at the franchise's rich history and realize just how much of an impact it's made on me and countless others. There are eras of my life that have been defined by Final Fantasy games and my connection to them.","content_length":932,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Final Fantasy 16 Review - On Its Own Terms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/","post_date":"June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDT","content":"Having seen FFXVI all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series.

It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms.","content_length":537,"content_tokens":115,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Layers Of Fear (2023) Review - Delusions Of Grandeur","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/layers-of-fear-2023-review-delusions-of-grandeur/1900-6418080/","date":"June 15, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"Bloober Team's original Layers of Fear (2016) became an almost overnight gaming sensation when its mind-bending Steam Early Access version gave players some truly imaginative sights. The sequel continued the original's themes of tortured artists, but swapped a painter for an actor, and offered arguably even more inventive visuals. Both games were, in my opinion, fine, but nothing more. Now, reborn on Unreal Engine 5 with new content interspersed with what was there before, Layers of Fear (2023) looks to be the definitive way to experience the horror series. However, its haunts remain largely empty. The new engine makes the game a visual benchmark, but it still feels more like a haunted house at a theme park, offering the illusion of danger but never something sincerely threatening. Perhaps the first hurdle in critiquing the series' reinvention is explaining exactly what this package offers. Layers of Fear and its sequel both return roughly 80% the same as you may have experienced them before. Some scenes have been redesigned or added--or even removed, if my memory serves me correctly. Both games receive new but ultimately shallow mechanics allowing for a few combat sections in which you'll need to blast stalking ghosts with light to stall them while you escape their maze-like settings. The first game's brief Inheritance DLC is also included, and a brand-new DLC meant to wrap the series up more neatly than before, The Final Note, makes its debut. The best part of all of this is actually the framing narrative, The Writer's Story. Built directly into the game as you progress through its connected parts, you'll routinely jump back to a lighthouse where a writer tells the story of the game's other haunted artists: the painter, the actor, and the musician. Like those in the main games, the writer is dealing with her own hauntings, and I find the format classy and quite novel for the medium. It feels like a horror anthology, such as V/H/S, only in this case, all the individual stories ultimately share a universe. Light combat elements have been added to address past complaints, but they don't add much to the games. This delivery is compelling, but it has the odd effect of making each individual piece more of a letdown, as they largely struggle to hold up on their own. Layers of Fear has always been more like an amusement park ride than a survival-horror experience, and that MO just doesn't feel conducive to generating actual tension. Even in these new versions--which try to add more possible game-over screens--moments are too scripted and enemies are basically non-existent. The novelty of entering a room, seeing something weird happen, then turning to find the environment has seamlessly changed before you is occasionally mind-melting, but never, ever scary. The first game also feels desperate to avoid being misunderstood, to the point where its story is laid out so bare, it betrays the adage of \"show, don't tell\" at every turn. The Final Note DLC seeks to over-explain even more by putting you in the role of the one person you never play as in the original or its Inheritance DLC. Inheritance also winds up being mechanically frustrating due to some confusing puzzles, but its intent to show the world through the eyes of a child make it more memorable than anything the other pieces do, unless you count the new DLC's broken enemy encounters, during which the ghost chasing me get stuck halfway in the floorboards. The highlight is certainly Layers of Fear 2, which does more with its setting and story than the rest of the series combined. Unlike the needlessly overt original, the sequel is perhaps too shrouded in metaphor at times, though it does make piecing it all together more interesting. For those who never played the original Layers of Fear games, this reimagined package is definitely a better first experience than the old versionsWhile the other games all take place in endless darkness, Layers of Fear 2 is set aboard a cruise ship where a movie was to be filmed, and it's not afraid to turn the lights on at times, constantly toying with different palettes and scenery. It winds up more memorable than the original's house, which feels the same room to room, albeit with some nightmarish scenes of its own to play off of. The story is at once a twisted tale of method acting, a dark tragedy, and a nearly constant homage to horror's past, with nods to The Shining, Psycho, and more laid out like displays in a horror museum. It's all narrated by actor Tony Todd too, who makes a great fit given the tenor of his voice, particularly if you're familiar with his body of work like Candyman and Final Destination. Still, not even Layers of Fear 2 can break free of the series' shackles. Gameplay across the series largely comes down to walking, opening doors, and seeing what weird scene awaits on the other side. Some light puzzles mix up the pacing, but the new chase sequences feel one-note, many of them even using the same dialogue lines time after time. To its credit, this new edition is built on Unreal Engine 5 and seems to utilize the new Lumen lighting technology, which makes games like Fortnite so jaw-dropping to look at. Here, the colors are naturally not as bright as Epic's cartoonish battle royale, but the lighting tech is dazzling nonetheless. I stopped in my tracks many times across the 10-12 hours it takes to finish all five experiences simply because the game looks amazing. With a best-in-series story and more visual variety, Layers of Fear 2 remains the series' high point. It's just too bad it rarely does more than that. Before, Layers of Fear offered some stunning scenes and a moody atmosphere. Now, nearly a decade later, the game somehow reinvents itself but adds very few new strengths, while its weaknesses only stand out more due to the effort that went into justifying the project in the first place. It feels like the studio heard the complaint of a lack of true threats in the games, but in seeking to polish out that blemish, just left more faults. For those who never played the original Layers of Fear games, this reimagined package is definitely a better first experience than the old versions, simply on account of looking better and adding the neat framing narrative of The Writer's Story. But for horror enthusiasts already well-versed in the series, its MO remains as smoke and mirrors. There are no real terrors lurking in the shadows just out of reach. There is only the suggestion of some, and like the many tortured artists at the center of its saga, they are left unfulfilled.","length":6591,"tokens":1374,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Layers Of Fear (2023) Review - Delusions Of Grandeur","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/layers-of-fear-2023-review-delusions-of-grandeur/1900-6418080/","post_date":"June 15, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"Bloober Team's original Layers of Fear (2016) became an almost overnight gaming sensation when its mind-bending Steam Early Access version gave players some truly imaginative sights.

Street Fighter 6 learns an immediate lesson from the content-bare release of its predecessor, as it offers a variety of significant features and modes right out of the gate. It is a robust fighting game that is of premiere quality. Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned pros. SF6 splits its content into three hubs: Fighting Ground, which most closely emulates the classic SF experience; Battle Hub, where players can congregate to challenge each other and compete in tournaments; and World Tour, which is a sprawling, globe-trotting story mode with an open world and RPG hooks.

Some have an in-your-face style with heavy strikes and damaging throws, while others are better suited to keeping their distance and picking moments to strike. What distinguishes SF6 from previous iterations are the core universal mechanics shared by all characters. While the effects and execution are the same for each fighter, these mechanics have their own distinct flair and flourish of personality depending on the character you choose. These universal mechanics are also where much of Street Fighter 6's gameplay depth is. The Drive system is SF6's new universal battle mechanic, and I'm amazed at how much it adds to a match despite being simple to grasp. By pressing the two medium attack buttons, I can parry an attack using Drive Parry, or, with Drive Rush, I can immediately dash forward out of it for a burst of speed that can catch opponents off guard or introduce new combo sequences. Functionally, players that are experienced with Street Fighter 4's Focus Attack Dash Cancel or Guilty Gear's Roman Cancels will feel right at home. By pressing both heavy attacks, I can initiate a Drive Impact that can stagger an opponent and leave them open, ensuring that overly defensive players can be opened up. If an opponent is backed into a corner, landing this will make them bounce off the wall, adding a variety of other strategic considerations and opportunities. Drive Reversals, meanwhile, allow me to block an attack and counter with a move that, while not very damaging, will help escape tricky spots. Finally, Overdrive lets me power up special attacks like the EX systems of old. These aren't unlimited, however, as each move uses up part of a Drive Gauge just below the health bar, and a fighter can \"burn out,\" which slows their movement and makes certain offensive and defensive moves inaccessible for a period. The strategic implications of this system cannot be overstated, as these new tools do wonders for the overall fighting system. Drive Impacts in particular can swing the tide of battle in an instant, as catching an unsuspecting opponent with one will allow you to put a hurting on them. Keeping these tools in front of your mind is key to victory, and luckily it's not an overwhelming amount to recall. One of the major criticisms leveled at Street Fighter 5 was the rigidity of battles, with some going so far as to call it turn-based. However, these new mechanics make Street Fighter 6 feel more fluid. Despite these differences, all 18 characters somehow feel balanced. I imagine once the pros get their hands on the game, a few top fighters will emerge, but from the jump there was never a matchup I thought to be too difficult to overcome. Characters who have previously suffered in other areas have new abilities to make up for it--Zangief, for example, has a running throw with armor properties that can absorb projectiles, which are an old nemesis of his. The new fighters also fit right into the mold, perfectly complimenting the existing roster while also serving as a new puzzle for players to crack open. I've already seen some Manon players online that gave me nightmares, and can only imagine how much more potent these new faces will be in the hands of the Street Fighter faithful. No matter how simple Street Fighter 6 can seem, novice players are going to feel some trepidation when stepping into the ring for the first time. The game is ready for you, though, as Capcom has implemented a new Modern control scheme that makes controlling fighters more like Super Smash Bros. than traditional Street Fighter. This gives new players a foundation from which to learn, but that growth does have a ceiling. If you decide to transition to the Classic control scheme, players will need to learn the manual input controls that have been used since Street Fighter 2. While Modern controls did not translate well for me personally--I've been throwing quarter-circle Hadokens since I was six years old--I always appreciate the offer of a new stepping stone for novice players. The easiest place to learn SF6, in either Modern or Classic style, is in Fighting Ground, which is the \"traditional\" SF experience. This is where you'll find familiar modes like Arcade Mode, online ranked and casual matches, and offline versus modes. This section's shining feature, however, is its Practice area, which houses some of the best in-game tutorials the series has ever had. Practice Mode has the classic freeform Training mode fans expect, but it also holds full tutorials for the game's core system as well as character guides and combo trials for all 18 characters on the roster. These character guides are a deep dive into what makes each fighter tick, as it explains not only their special moves, but also the best situations in which to use them. While I am a Zangief main, I've spent time in these modes to be confident enough with Marisa to take her online, and it didn't take me long to get there. Street Fighter 6 is a robust, fighting game that is of a premiere quality ... Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned prosFighting Ground also lets you tinker with in-game commentators, one of the more ballyhooed features of Street Fighter 6. The game allows players to pick real-world commentators from the fighting game community, who \"call\" matches as if players are competing at Evo. While the novelty is fun at first--hearing Steve \"TastySteve\" Scott and WWE's Zelina Vega in an official Street Fighter game is super cool--the excitement those commentators generate during an actual tournament isn't ever captured here. Those experiences are fueled by genuine, off-the-cuff reactions to the action on the screen and in the arena, while those same voices sound like they're reading situations from a script here (which, of course, is exactly what they are doing). It's a problem similar to what WWE video games have dealt with in the past; trying to script reactions in such a way that they sound spontaneous is incredibly hard to do, and this admirable attempt misses the mark. If you're looking for a less traditional experience than what's offered in Fighting Ground, it's time to take a World Tour. This is a massive story mode with multiple chapters that unfolds across the entire world. The main hub is Metro City of Final Fight fame, and it is stuffed with things to do and references for longtime Capcom fighting game fans to find. The rest of the mode is broken up into smaller locations based on stages from the core game. Italy's Colosseo is where you find Marisa, and Jamaica's Bathers Beach is Dee Jay's hangout, for example. These are one-off locales you'll visit sparingly, so they're not as big as Metro City, but they all still have a charm to them. The story being told in World Tour does not live up to the standard set by fighting games like Tekken 7 and Mortal Kombat 11. However, this isn't much of a problem, as everything happening around the story makes up for it in a big way. World Tour is essentially a Street Fighter RPG, where the fighting mechanics serve as the battle system, and it is very silly fun. As I'm walking through the streets of Metro City, I can challenge virtually anyone I want to a fight, be they a food truck attendant, an old lady going to the store, or a young troublemaker getting up to no good. Some potential opponents will initiate the attack instead, and can sometimes come in a group, forcing players to defeat a series of opponents. With every victory, my avatar gains experience and levels up both their core stats and the fighting styles I'm using at the time. This \"challenge anyone\" mechanic is also technically impressive, as it really does let players challenge anyone. The game seamlessly goes from challenging a passerby, into a fight, and then returning to free roaming without loading. The \"stage\" is whatever we were standing in front of at that moment, and as I'm fighting, other NPCs that were standing around will flow into the background and cheer us on. There is a sacrifice being made here, however, and for some it might be a big one--there is a noticeable dip in frame rate when fighting in World Tour, one that immediately reverts to 60 FPS once you're out of a battle. And the visual quality of the stages and random fighters is nowhere near as good as Ryu fighting Ken on a carefully crafted stage. These performance issues are unfortunate, but I didn't focus on them much as I was too busy enjoying the silliness of fighting every Metro City denizen that passed by me, or using money to buy a hat that somehow improves my kicking power. The hero in World Tour is a fully customizable avatar you create, and you have control over everything from their hair to their body size. As previously mentioned, clothing can be purchased or earned as rewards throughout the mode, with each piece of clothing offering a stat boost in a certain area. Also, if you have a favorite costume set, but you know you have more powerful gear, you can set your appearance separately from what's equipped. This lets you look how you want while also getting all of the benefits of the new gear you pick up, which is a huge plus. While I want to be able to fight like a ninja, I don't always want to look like one, and World Tour offers that flexibility. Leveling up fighting styles is the other major customization option and growth path. Your avatar's moveset is in your hands, and as you progress through the story of World Tour, you meet the 18 \"masters\" of the world--aka the playable roster of Street Fighter characters. After earning their respect through mission completion or even a one-on-one fight, your avatar will be \"enrolled\" as a student and given access to that character's moveset. You'll pick a core moveset for normals, but then you can pick and choose which special moves you want your character to use. At one point, my avatar used Dee Jay's Rolling Sobat, Blanka's Rolling Attack, Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick, and Ken's Shoryuken, and I could change things up whenever I wanted. That versatility and ability to create your own fighter down to the moveset is something new for the franchise and a core part of what makes World Tour fun. Using a fight stick to control an avatar in this mode is rough. The camera controls do not translate to a controller with only one stick, so getting around the city is cumbersome. The game does offer a solution, though not an elegant one: I can activate my fight stick as \"Player 1\" and my normal controller as \"Player 2,\" and switch between the two at will depending on if I'm moving around Metro City or fighting a Mad Gear member. While this does mean extra space is needed for two controllers at once, I appreciate the convenience of the easy switch every time I want to use it. Your avatar also takes center stage in the Battle Hub, which is the final section of the Street Fighter 6 experience. This is basically a middle ground between World Tour and Fighting Ground, where players bring their avatars into a massive dome lined with arcade cabinets. You can sit down at a cabinet and wait for a challenger while training, or you can join a queue of players already seated, the digital equivalent of putting a quarter on the machine. This brings me to one of the major sticking points of any fighting game in the modern era: Netcode. Street Fighter 6's netcode sings, no matter who I'm fighting or, incredibly, which server I'm logged into. I made sure to log into the North America, South America, and Asia servers during my review time, and nearly every match I played in all three felt like my opponent was sitting in the room next to me. That's not to say it's perfect, as personal internet connections also are a major factor in performance, but the advent of rollback netcode has been a major boon to the entire fighting genre, and Street Fighter 6 is the latest beneficiary. I had a couple of matches in the North America region that did have some netcode issues, but my online play experience as a whole has been overwhelmingly positive. Gallery If you want some variety, you can venture over to the classic games section of the hub, which offers full arcade ports of games from the classic Capcom catalog. Street Fighter 2, Final Fight, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo were all available during the review period, and every one of them ran beautifully both when playing free play and shooting for the top of the leaderboard in High Score Challenge. Or, if you want something more novel, you can walk into the center of the arena and challenge anyone in there to a fight using your avatar, with each fighter based on their current World Tour builds. These fights can get wacky whether you're in them or spectating them, and they were always a welcome change of pace after multiple matches at the arcade machines. I expect Battle Hub to be a major hangout when the game launches, and while I cannot predict how the online experience will hold up when that happens, I can say that my time for this review was clean as a sheet. Fighting games in the modern age live on through their extra content, and Street Fighter 6 is no exception. Capcom has not only already confirmed the first four characters coming via downloadable content, but, much like Street Fighter 5, the game will feature its own economy complete with multiple currencies--Drive Tickets that are earned in-game, and Fighter Coins that can be earned in-game or purchased separately--as well as a battle pass which will offer avatar gear, emotes, and other perks in both a free and premium track. Given how strong the base game is, having more content and being able to play the game in different ways is an exciting prospect. I can't get enough of Street Fighter 6. It's been my last thought when I go to bed and my first thought when I wake up. It has a beautifully constructed fighting system, but also offers modes that take the game very seriously and, in other cases, not seriously at all. There are some small issues with performance in World Tour, but none of those are enough to derail the overall package. With the releases of new Tekken and Mortal Kombat games, it very much feels like we're in a new golden era for the fighting game genre. Thankfully, Street Fighter 6 steps into the arena looking good and fighting fit.","length":17569,"tokens":3737,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"In one play session, I'm honing my skills with my main man Zangief.

The game seamlessly goes from challenging a passerby, into a fight, and then returning to free roaming without loading. The \"stage\" is whatever we were standing in front of at that moment, and as I'm fighting, other NPCs that were standing around will flow into the background and cheer us on.","content_length":892,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"There is a sacrifice being made here, however, and for some it might be a big one--there is a noticeable dip in frame rate when fighting in World Tour, one that immediately reverts to 60 FPS once you're out of a battle. And the visual quality of the stages and random fighters is nowhere near as good as Ryu fighting Ken on a carefully crafted stage. These performance issues are unfortunate, but I didn't focus on them much as I was too busy enjoying the silliness of fighting every Metro City denizen that passed by me, or using money to buy a hat that somehow improves my kicking power. The hero in World Tour is a fully customizable avatar you create, and you have control over everything from their hair to their body size. As previously mentioned, clothing can be purchased or earned as rewards throughout the mode, with each piece of clothing offering a stat boost in a certain area.","content_length":890,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"Also, if you have a favorite costume set, but you know you have more powerful gear, you can set your appearance separately from what's equipped. This lets you look how you want while also getting all of the benefits of the new gear you pick up, which is a huge plus. While I want to be able to fight like a ninja, I don't always want to look like one, and World Tour offers that flexibility. Leveling up fighting styles is the other major customization option and growth path. Your avatar's moveset is in your hands, and as you progress through the story of World Tour, you meet the 18 \"masters\" of the world--aka the playable roster of Street Fighter characters. After earning their respect through mission completion or even a one-on-one fight, your avatar will be \"enrolled\" as a student and given access to that character's moveset.","content_length":836,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"You'll pick a core moveset for normals, but then you can pick and choose which special moves you want your character to use. At one point, my avatar used Dee Jay's Rolling Sobat, Blanka's Rolling Attack, Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick, and Ken's Shoryuken, and I could change things up whenever I wanted. That versatility and ability to create your own fighter down to the moveset is something new for the franchise and a core part of what makes World Tour fun. Using a fight stick to control an avatar in this mode is rough. The camera controls do not translate to a controller with only one stick, so getting around the city is cumbersome. The game does offer a solution, though not an elegant one: I can activate my fight stick as \"Player 1\" and my normal controller as \"Player 2,\" and switch between the two at will depending on if I'm moving around Metro City or fighting a Mad Gear member.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"While this does mean extra space is needed for two controllers at once, I appreciate the convenience of the easy switch every time I want to use it. Your avatar also takes center stage in the Battle Hub, which is the final section of the Street Fighter 6 experience. This is basically a middle ground between World Tour and Fighting Ground, where players bring their avatars into a massive dome lined with arcade cabinets. You can sit down at a cabinet and wait for a challenger while training, or you can join a queue of players already seated, the digital equivalent of putting a quarter on the machine. This brings me to one of the major sticking points of any fighting game in the modern era: Netcode. Street Fighter 6's netcode sings, no matter who I'm fighting or, incredibly, which server I'm logged into.","content_length":812,"content_tokens":165,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"I made sure to log into the North America, South America, and Asia servers during my review time, and nearly every match I played in all three felt like my opponent was sitting in the room next to me. That's not to say it's perfect, as personal internet connections also are a major factor in performance, but the advent of rollback netcode has been a major boon to the entire fighting genre, and Street Fighter 6 is the latest beneficiary. I had a couple of matches in the North America region that did have some netcode issues, but my online play experience as a whole has been overwhelmingly positive. Gallery If you want some variety, you can venture over to the classic games section of the hub, which offers full arcade ports of games from the classic Capcom catalog.","content_length":773,"content_tokens":157,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"Street Fighter 2, Final Fight, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo were all available during the review period, and every one of them ran beautifully both when playing free play and shooting for the top of the leaderboard in High Score Challenge. Or, if you want something more novel, you can walk into the center of the arena and challenge anyone in there to a fight using your avatar, with each fighter based on their current World Tour builds. These fights can get wacky whether you're in them or spectating them, and they were always a welcome change of pace after multiple matches at the arcade machines. I expect Battle Hub to be a major hangout when the game launches, and while I cannot predict how the online experience will hold up when that happens, I can say that my time for this review was clean as a sheet. Fighting games in the modern age live on through their extra content, and Street Fighter 6 is no exception.","content_length":926,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"Capcom has not only already confirmed the first four characters coming via downloadable content, but, much like Street Fighter 5, the game will feature its own economy complete with multiple currencies--Drive Tickets that are earned in-game, and Fighter Coins that can be earned in-game or purchased separately--as well as a battle pass which will offer avatar gear, emotes, and other perks in both a free and premium track. Given how strong the base game is, having more content and being able to play the game in different ways is an exciting prospect. I can't get enough of Street Fighter 6. It's been my last thought when I go to bed and my first thought when I wake up. It has a beautifully constructed fighting system, but also offers modes that take the game very seriously and, in other cases, not seriously at all. There are some small issues with performance in World Tour, but none of those are enough to derail the overall package. With the releases of new Tekken and Mortal Kombat games, it very much feels like we're in a new golden era for the fighting game genre. Thankfully, Street Fighter 6 steps into the arena looking good and fighting fit.","content_length":1159,"content_tokens":239,"embedding":[]}]}]}
