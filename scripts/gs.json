Cherry KW X ULP Review","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-a-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard-good-for-gaming-cherry-kw-x-ulp-review/1100-6515627/","date":"June 30, 2023 at 1:48PM PDT","content":"Cherry is well-known as a pioneer in the keyboard space for its widely adopted mechanical switches. If you've dabbled in the realm of high-performance keyboards, whether it be for professional use or competitive gaming, you've heard of (and probably used) Cherry MX switches. And you may be well-versed in the distinction between the clicky, tactical MX Blues and the smooth, linear MX Reds (and the several variations in between). While the company hasn't historically dealt in keyboards itself as deeply as other peripheral manufacturers such as Logitech, Razer, Corsair, and the like, it does have a select few high-end keyboards. The latest Cherry put out is the low-profile KW X ULP , and I've been fascinated by the prospect of an ultra-slim, ultra-light mechanical keyboard that still uses the full-sized 104-key layout, but is it suited for gaming?The Cherry KW X ULP ultra-slim mechanical keyboard. See at Amazon The short answer is: not entirely. It comes down to the overall feel of Cherry's proprietary MX Ultra Low Profile mechanical switches. They're much more responsive than a standard membrane design or a slim Apple keyboard since they offer a consistent and responsive keystroke with solid tactility. But my main issue is with how these mechanical switches bounce back--they feel somewhat squishy after a keystroke, as if the keys sink into the board itself. It's like the keys stick to the bottom just a bit too much before coming back up, and in the context of both competitive gaming and high-speed typing, it can hinder your ability to hit your skill ceiling. One of the other big factors is that there is no practical travel distance before hitting the actuation point with MX Ultra Low Profile switches. It's rated as having a 0.8mm travel distance, but its keys don't move downward until they receive enough force (65 cN), which will also register a keystroke. This design is a necessary compromise to maintain the super-slim build (at just 0.63 inches in height). However, travel distance in other full-sized mechanical switches offers immediate feedback on the actuation force, and therefore, a predictable feel for reaching the actuation point in a keystroke. That precision is a major reason why typists and PC gamers alike gravitate towards mechanical keyboards and are so particular about which switch they prefer. As per usual when it comes to testing peripherals, I used the Cherry KW X ULP keyboard when playing Valorant to get a sense of how it performs in a tight, competitive shooter, and in Final Fantasy XIV where I'm using a wider range of keys for engaging in the MMORPGs systems. Fast and sudden movements in Valorant were a little tougher, particularly with quick-strafing and jiggle-peeking around corners, which you're frequently doing each round. It's that slight stickiness, when the key bounces back after letting it go, that makes it somewhat tough to be quick on the draw and reliably position myself to line up pixel-perfect shots. Compared to my Keychron K4, the KW X ULP is razor-thin at just 0.63 inches. For an MMORPG like FFXIV, nearly every action in the game is mapped to a key, especially when it comes to precise attack rotations and clutch utility skills for high-level raids. The stiffness in the keystrokes can wear down your fingers the deeper you get in long boss fights. However, I must say that the layout of the KW X ULP (with each key socket separated by the board's chassis), the tactility of these switches, and the necessary actuation force meant that I made fewer errant inputs. Never did I unintentionally use the wrong skill or mistakenly hit a wrong key in the heat of battle when using the KW X ULP--which happens more often than I like to admit when using keyboards with my preferred Cherry MX Red switches. If you are error-prone, you can at least rely on the MX Ultra Low Profile to mitigate those potential mistakes. Don't get me wrong, the Cherry KW X ULP is a beautifully built piece of tech with a great minimalist design. It's a no-frills keyboard with a sleek brushed-aluminum top chassis and a plastic bottom to keep it lightweight at 22 oz. The white backlighting is bright and clear, and the separation between each individual key gives it a tidy look that's also practical for the user experience (as FFXIV demonstrated). Because of how these low-profile switches are built, they remain relatively quiet--you won't get that satisfying \"thock\" sound that has become synonymous with mechanical keyboards, but they'll produce about the same amount of noise level as my Keychron K4 with dampening rings. The KW X ULP is also a wireless keyboard that comes with a responsive 2.4GHz dongle that keeps up with my inputs while gaming and Bluetooth capability for usability across various devices. It can be wired in through a USB-C cable (which it also charges from). And when it comes to battery life, this keyboard will last a long time after a full charge--I've been using it for two weeks straight in office and gaming settings, totaling roughly 100+ hours of usage with backlighting set to its maximum, and I still haven't had to plug it back in.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4160046-img_2682. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4160046-img_2682. jpg 4032w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4160046-img_2682. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/4160046-img_2682. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">This isn't a keyboard for customization, not that I was expecting it to be. And at least in the gaming keyboard space, personalization is one of the big draws for some. Things like aftermarket keycaps, noise dampening rings, custom backlighting aren't options here. You do get features like volume control keys and Windows key lock, but overall, you get the essentials; nothing more, nothing less. I will say that it's a lovely keyboard to have in the office because of its small footprint, full layout, wireless capabilities, and relatively quiet keystrokes. Solely from a typing perspective, the squishiness of the switches slightly undermines the advantages of going with a mechanical keyboard. And while it isn't exactly pitched as a gaming keyboard, if you find a mechanical keyboard with an ultra-slim design to be an attractive prospect and were wondering if this could proficiently bridge the gap between gaming and low-profile, it comes up a bit short in a few key areas. This is far from the first low-profile mechanical keyboard on the market, but it is the latest, and Cherry has been in the game for a very long time. However, this particular model is tough to recommend given the price and overall feel when either typing or gaming compared to keyboards with full-sized mechanical switches. Overall, the Cherry KW X ULP is good, but it's not \"$250\" good. Soon, we'll be looking at Cherry's MX-LP 2.1 low-profile mechanical keyboard , which is a model tuned for gaming. It uses many different design principles and it may not be as thin, but it has MX Silver Speed switches, comes with slim-fit keycaps, and uses the 65% compact layout.","length":7246,"tokens":1644,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

But my main issue is with how these mechanical switches bounce back--they feel somewhat squishy after a keystroke, as if the keys sink into the board itself.","content_length":743,"content_tokens":160,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

One of the other big factors is that there is no practical travel distance before hitting the actuation point with MX Ultra Low Profile switches. It's rated as having a 0.8mm travel distance, but its keys don't move downward until they receive enough force (65 cN), which will also register a keystroke. This design is a necessary compromise to maintain the super-slim build (at just 0.63 inches in height) However, travel distance in other full-sized mechanical switches offers immediate feedback on the actuation force, and therefore, a predictable feel for reaching the actuation point in a keystroke. That precision is a major reason why typists and PC gamers alike gravitate towards mechanical keyboards and are so particular about which switch they prefer.","content_length":967,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

Fast and sudden movements in Valorant were a little tougher, particularly with quick-strafing and jiggle-peeking around corners, which you're frequently doing each round. It's that slight stickiness, when the key bounces back after letting it go, that makes it somewhat tough to be quick on the draw and reliably position myself to line up pixel-perfect shots. Compared to my Keychron K4, the KW X ULP is razor-thin at just 0.63 inches.","content_length":712,"content_tokens":165,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

The stiffness in the keystrokes can wear down your fingers the deeper you get in long boss fights. However, I must say that the layout of the KW X ULP (with each key socket separated by the board's chassis), the tactility of these switches, and the necessary actuation force meant that I made fewer errant inputs. Never did I unintentionally use the wrong skill or mistakenly hit a wrong key in the heat of battle when using the KW X ULP--which happens more often than I like to admit when using keyboards with my preferred Cherry MX Red switches. If you are error-prone, you can at least rely on the MX Ultra Low Profile to mitigate those potential mistakes.","content_length":838,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

It's a no-frills keyboard with a sleek brushed-aluminum top chassis and a plastic bottom to keep it lightweight at 22 oz. The white backlighting is bright and clear, and the separation between each individual key gives it a tidy look that's also practical for the user experience (as FFXIV demonstrated) Because of how these low-profile switches are built, they remain relatively quiet--you won't get that satisfying \"thock\" sound that has become synonymous with mechanical keyboards, but they'll produce about the same amount of noise level as my Keychron K4 with dampening rings. The KW X ULP is also a wireless keyboard that comes with a responsive 2.4GHz dongle that keeps up with my inputs while gaming and Bluetooth capability for usability across various devices.","content_length":879,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming?

And while it isn't exactly pitched as a gaming keyboard, if you find a mechanical keyboard with an ultra-slim design to be an attractive prospect and were wondering if this could proficiently bridge the gap between gaming and low-profile, it comes up a bit short in a few key areas. This is far from the first low-profile mechanical keyboard on the market, but it is the latest, and Cherry has been in the game for a very long time. However, this particular model is tough to recommend given the price and overall feel when either typing or gaming compared to keyboards with full-sized mechanical switches. Overall, the Cherry KW X ULP is good, but it's not \"$250\" good. Soon, we'll be looking at Cherry's MX-LP 2.1 low-profile mechanical keyboard , which is a model tuned for gaming. It uses many different design principles and it may not be as thin, but it has MX Silver Speed switches, comes with slim-fit keycaps, and uses the 65% compact layout.","content_length":1088,"content_tokens":238,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Games Are Announced Too Early | Spot On","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/games-are-announced-too-early-spot-on/1100-6515619/","date":"June 30, 2023 at 1:38PM PDT","content":"A new Perfect Dark was revealed at The Game Awards way back in 2020, but a recent report from IGN has indicated that its release is still years away, despite Xbox's Matt Booty saying that he played it recently.

Deadline reported on these developments. The prosecutors filed a motion to protect the witness's identity, citing concerns about media harassment and potential industry blacklisting. Gutierrez-Reed's lawyer refuted the claims, stating the lack of corroboration or evidence. This revelation was disclosed in a recent filing by special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis, who have added a charge of tampering with evidence against Gutierrez-Reed, stating that she allegedly \"did transfer narcotics to another person with the intent to prevent the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of herself.\" The specific type of drug involved was not disclosed at the time of the filing. Earlier this month, Morrissey and Lewis filed a motion stating that witnesses in the case would testify that Gutierrez-Reed had been heavily drinking and smoking marijuana during the evenings while working on Rust. They also suggested that she may have been hungover on the morning of October 21, 2021, when a prop firearm, which was loaded with a live round and being handled by actor Alec Baldwin, discharged during a rehearsal on the set at Bonanza Creek Ranch. The incident resulted in the tragic death of Halyna Hutchens and the injury of director Joel Souza. In response to the prosecutors' claims, Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, Jason Bowles, refuted the allegations, labeling them as false. Bowles accused the prosecutors of intentionally introducing irrelevant and inflammatory arguments to unfairly influence public opinion against his client. Regarding the recent filing and the undisclosed witness, Bowles expressed skepticism, stating, \"A secret witness appears 20 months later? With no actual corroboration or evidence? And the state won't identify the person? This is a throwback to the secret, star chamber prosecutions in England in the 15th century that were abolished.

The company appears to be working on a remake of Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. According to a report from Kotaku, the project is still in early development and will not be ready for a few years. The report also says that a team at Ubisoft Singapore will be heavily involved in ensuring the game is up to modern standards. Besides that, not much is known about the upcoming remake, and it's unclear if Ubisoft will take inspiration from recent titles such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla to include more RPG elements. It's also worth mentioning that this isn't the only pirate game Ubisoft is making. The studio has been working on Skull and Bones since 2013, but since then, the game has been delayed multiple times and will now be released in the 2024 fiscal year. Despite the multiple delays, Ubisoft announced a closed beta for Skull and Bones that'll run from August 25-28. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag was released in 2013 on multiple platforms, including the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One, as well as later on Switch and Google Stadia (RIP).

Big-name games like Starfield are coming in 2023, as are several high-profile remakes of classic games.

Each game listing also shows supported platforms so you can figure out just what you're going to buy this year. As more games are announced and given release dates, this list will be further updated, and we'll also continue to adjust it if games are delayed.

As usual, he's brought with him a selection of Exotics and Legendary-class gear, just in time for a Trials of Osiris weekend. Here's where you can find Xur this week and what the Agent of the Nine has for sale. This week you can find Xur on Nessus, in the Watcher's Grave. For his weapon, Xur is offering the Crimson hand cannon. Hunters can pick up Orpheus Rig leg armor; Titans can grab the Helm of Saint-14 helmet; and Warlocks can buy the Nezarec's Sin helmet. Xur LocationXur's location on Nessus. Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week. When you arrive, hop on your sparrow and head north toward the exit of the area. Look for a big tree with pink moss on the right side of the area. Climb up onto its big, flat branch, where you can reach Xur.

Starless Night blinds enemies who enter the bubble, allies gain an overshield, and if you're running with Sentinel Shield, guarding with it will also blind your opponents. This build has a high intellect stat, which is great for building Supers quickly, but the high mobility isn't well-suited for Titans. Discipline is also very low, and the rest of the stats are around average at best.

Destiny 2's high-level PvE activity has seen some big changes recently, and now is a great time to attempt that perfect Flawless run so that you can grab some excellent rewards. You can also check out where Xur is before you dive in this weekend, just in case the Agent of the Nine has some high-stat gear for sale. Here's a look at where you'll play Trials of Osiris this weekend and what weapons you can earn. Map: BannerfallReputation Rank 4: Upgrade ModuleReputation Rank 7: Enhancement PrismReputation Rank 10: The Messenger (Pulse rifle)Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade ModuleReputation Rank 16: Unexpected Resurgence (Glaive)Flawless Reward: Exalted Truth (Adept)Season of the Deep is adding some excellent new rewards to the Trials pool, and if you're a fan of shaders, then there's a glorious golden one to grab from this multiplayer event. Alongside the Glorious Patina shader, Trials will also have some new Exotic cosmetic gear to unlock, including a new Ghost shell, ship, and Sparrow. Glorious Patina will only be available to players who go Flawless during Season 21, and the weapon pool is being updated with The Messenger pulse rifle and the Unexpected Resurgence glaive as possible prizes. A new emblem has been added, but you'll need to get a Flight of the Pigeon medal for every win and open the Flawless chest at the Lighthouse to obtain it. The other big change to Trials this season is the debut of an introductory quest that provides a proper tutorial for new Trials players, and completing it will reward players with the Astral Horizon Trials Shotgun. Trials Passage offerings have also been updated to provide a better experience, starting with Passage of Wealth. This will now grant +75 Trials reputation for every win and an additional bonus for your current major rank in Trials, up to +150 total. Passage of Mercy will now forgive two losses if you have not yet been Flawless for the week, and after going Flawless, it reverts back to a state where it forgives a single loss on each card after you reset it. This season's core game mode is Dominion, which Bungie says was chosen because it is overall faster, promotes more varied engagements, and provides a healthier sandbox variety. As a reminder, Trials weapons carry the Alacrity Origin Trait, which gives you increased aim assist, reload speed, stability, and range on these weapons when you're the last living member of a fireteam or running solo. You can also choose to swap to the Crucible Origin trait, One Quiet Moment, which greatly enhances your gun's reload speed when you reload while out of combat. Trials goes live from Friday's daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET until the weekly reset at the same time the following Tuesday. Make sure to pay a visit to Saint-14 in the Tower to pick up a Trials card, which will dictate certain bonuses (such as whether you get bonus rewards at certain milestones or if a loss will be forgiven). Your ultimate goal in the Trials of Osiris is for you and the other two players in your fireteam to achieve a \"Flawless\" run, in which you win seven matches without losing any. Go Flawless and you'll earn a trip to the Lighthouse and receive some special rewards, including the Adept weapons. These have additional stat bonuses, making them among the most coveted items you can get your hands on. Your Trials Passage--the card you purchase from Saint-14 that grants you access to the mode and tracks your wins--does not track your losses, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you lose out on a Flawless run.","length":3644,"tokens":791,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Trials Of Osiris Rewards This Week In Destiny 2 (June 30-July 4)","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny-2-june-30-july-4/1100-6515613/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:36AM PDT","content":"After a short break to make room for the Iron Banner, Trials of Osiris is back in action this week.

The other big change to Trials this season is the debut of an introductory quest that provides a proper tutorial for new Trials players, and completing it will reward players with the Astral Horizon Trials Shotgun. Trials Passage offerings have also been updated to provide a better experience, starting with Passage of Wealth. This will now grant +75 Trials reputation for every win and an additional bonus for your current major rank in Trials, up to +150 total. Passage of Mercy will now forgive two losses if you have not yet been Flawless for the week, and after going Flawless, it reverts back to a state where it forgives a single loss on each card after you reset it.","content_length":830,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Trials Of Osiris Rewards This Week In Destiny 2 (June 30-July 4)","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny-2-june-30-july-4/1100-6515613/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:36AM PDT","content":"This season's core game mode is Dominion, which Bungie says was chosen because it is overall faster, promotes more varied engagements, and provides a healthier sandbox variety. As a reminder, Trials weapons carry the Alacrity Origin Trait, which gives you increased aim assist, reload speed, stability, and range on these weapons when you're the last living member of a fireteam or running solo. You can also choose to swap to the Crucible Origin trait, One Quiet Moment, which greatly enhances your gun's reload speed when you reload while out of combat. Trials goes live from Friday's daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET until the weekly reset at the same time the following Tuesday.

These have additional stat bonuses, making them among the most coveted items you can get your hands on. Your Trials Passage--the card you purchase from Saint-14 that grants you access to the mode and tracks your wins--does not track your losses, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you lose out on a Flawless run.","content_length":622,"content_tokens":136,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Best Buy Fourth Of July Sale - Save Big On TVs, Laptops, Games, And More","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-buy-fourth-of-july-sale-save-big-on-tvs-laptops-games-and-more/1100-6515608/","date":"June 30, 2023 at 10:36AM PDT","content":"Best Buy is running a big Fourth of July Sale until Tuesday, giving you a chance to score games, TVs, headphones, laptops, and other electronics at low prices.

Some of these happen to have side quests, which can also be completed along the way. Our Diablo 4 dungeons and side quests guide discusses how you can make the best use of your time by tackling side quests found within dungeons to gain more renown as you play. Here's a complete breakdown on which dungeons have side quests in Diablo 4.

The reason is primarily due to renown gains. When you complete a side quest or clear a dungeon for the first time, you'll earn renown. This mechanic itself is important, as it allows you to unlock bonuses per region. It's good to keep this concept in mind if you're new to the game, or if you plan on starting from scratch when participating in seasonal content. Gallery Left: Light's Watch has a nifty reward for Sorcerers; Right: You'll want to venture into Hoarfrost Demise as a Necromancer. Similarly, dungeon completions provide you with a Legendary Aspect that's automatically saved in your Codex of Power. This lets you imprint a particular perk to a valid item so you can fine-tune your build. In any case, let's go back to the Diablo 4 dungeons with side quests. A handy list has been compiled by Reddit user Tyndy, as well as other players. Likewise, we have a dungeon locations guide, in case you'd like to know all the Aspect rewards in the game. Moreover, we also suggest checking out our Strongholds guide, as there are some areas that will only become available once you've conquered the Stronghold in question. Gallery Left: You'll need to conquer Tul Dulra Stronghold in Scosglen to gain access to a couple of dungeons and side quests; Right: Chieftain Ealda's quest chain has objectives in two dungeons in the Dry Steppes.

For $10/month, subscribers can access hundreds of games on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One, all downloaded locally to minimize latency and provide the same experience you'd get if you bought them. For another $5, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes PC game access and Xbox Live Gold, so you can play the games online, as well as Xbox streaming access. Every first-party Xbox game is released via Xbox Game Pass on launch day, and a ton of third-party titles are also available on the service. Below, you can find a complete list of every game available currently through Game Pass. Some of our favorite games on the list are bolded. [Updated with June's newest batch of games.] In addition to these new releases, see our picks for the best Xbox Game Pass Top Picks. Certain games also occasionally leave the Xbox Game Pass lineup.

As of right now, the only content that fans have to consume is the launch game itself. Of course, going through the campaign of Diablo 4 plus all of the endgame/PvP activities is nothing to scoff at. Still, some fans might be longing for the first season of the game, which will introduce a plethora of additional content. The details surrounding Season 1 of Diablo 4 are still sparse at the moment. However, the developers at Blizzard have let us in on some key parts of Season 1, including what the battle pass could contain and its release window. We'll go into all of the pertinent details you need to know about the battle pass and Season 1 of Diablo 4 in the guide below. Diablo 4 Season 1 release date and contentAt the time of writing, the only information we have regarding the release date for Season 1 is \"mid-late July.\" This comes directly from Blizzard, as the developers stated Season 1 would arrive roughly a month and a half arrive the game's initial launch on June 6. As June goes on, we should hear more official details on the firm release date for Season 1. As for the content Season 1 will bring, we have a better idea of what that will entail. Players will get to access new questlines featuring new and returning characters, balance changes for classes and gameplay items, new legendary items, and additional gameplay features, among other things. However, before getting to partake in what Season 1 has to offer, players must finish the campaign of Diablo 4 with at least one character on their account. Blizzard has recommended players do this now so they can hop right into Season 1 whenever it releases. Season 1 battle bassThe current look of the Season 1 battle passIn addition to all of that content, the game's first battle pass will be included with Season 1 as well. Blizzard has stressed that the battle pass is optional to buy and there are several free tiers of content (27 tiers) players will be able to access. If players wish to purchase the battle pass, they will be able to unlock those 27 free tiers as well as 63 paid tiers. Players can level up their battle pass by simply playing Diablo 4. Slaying demons and monsters, completing dungeons, and partaking in endgame content will all earn you battle pass XP so you can rank up to the next tier. Although players can also use the Season Journey to quickly rank up their battle pass, it should be noted that players will need to start fresh with a new character to access the Season 1 content--a detail that has confused or even upset some players. Hey Paul, yes to take part in the seasonal questline, mechanics, season journey and battle pass, you will need to create a new seasonal character. Playing campaign with seasonal character (if you so desire or need to finish) will also progress the season journey and battle pass. — Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) June 19, 2023 The Season Journey allows players to complete objectives within Chapters, which in turn rewards you with Favor. This is the currency that is used to rank up your battle pass from tier to tier. The more Favor you earn, the quicker you can reach tier 100. The objectives and Chapters in the Season Journey also reward players with other items as well, such as Murmuring Obols, Legendary Aspects, and more. Each season of Diablo 4 is meant to go on for about three months, in line with many other games' schedules of releasing four seasons in any given year. Diablo seasons and what carries overAs we mentioned, you'll need to play seasonal content with a new character and first have beaten the game at least once with any character--you need not replay the campaign to gain access to seasonal content, thankfully. Furthermore, Blizzard recently revealed that it's altered some plans regarding which in-game systems would start fresh with a new season. Previously the team planned on asking players to re-find evert Altar of Lilith, regain their Renown, and basically start completely fresh as a new season arrived. Mercifully, that's no longer the case. During a dev chat shared publicly, general manager Rod Fergusson said progress related to player Renown levels, uncovering world maps, and Altar of Lilith locations will not reset with each new season. Fast-travel waypoints will still be marked on the map, though players will need to revisit them to activate them once more. Fergusson added that activites players will need to complete again include things like dungeons, Strongholds, and some side quests, but added that the team is continuing to re-evaluate these reset requirements, meaning future changes could be on the way, too. It's often the case that teams first trying their hand at new or different live-service elements fidget with those elements a lot in the early life of a game. Battle pass priceOne bit of potential controversy that arises with any battle pass in a live service game is the pricing model developers use. In Diablo 4, players can purchase one of two versions, the Premium or Accelerated track. The Premium version costs 1,000 Platinum ($10) while the Accelerated version costs 2,800 Platinum ($25). If you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Diablo 4, you will unlock the Premium version automatically while Ultimate Edition buyers get the Accelerated version. The Accelerated version differs from the Premium in that players get 20 tier skips right off the bat as well as an exclusive cosmetic item. Speaking of cosmetics, that is mostly what the Diablo 4 battle pass will be filled with in Season 1. Players will be able to earn gold, emotes, character cosmetics, titles, and more. However, there are also tiers with Season Boosts and Smoldering Ashes as rewards. Season Boosts are basically XP boosters for your character while Smoldering Ashes are used to unlock Season Blessings. The blessings are buffs that give you bonus XP, Gold, or Obols when they are active. You can have more than one Season Blessing active at a time, meaning you will be earning bonus XP, Gold, or Obols at the same time while playing. Season Blessings provide players with extra boosts in Diablo 4. The one caveat with Season Blessings is that players need to be at a certain character level to activate them. This basically ensures players can't \"pay-to-win\" and purchase tier skips to immediately gain access to gameplay boosts. More details on Diablo 4 Season 1 shall emerge as the summer rolls on, so stay tuned for updates as we near the game's inaugural season.

The trail of allegations goes back a decade to his time at Yale, which the young actor attended to study the dramatic arts. Rolling Stone spoke to over 20 anonymous sources about the actor's domestic abuse charge from March with charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment after a domestic dispute with a 30-year-old woman. These sources claim Majors has a history of abusive behavior throughout previous relationships.\"No one is surprised that this is coming out,\" one source stated. \"It always felt like it was a matter of time because his behavior never changed. He's kind of a bad dude, and now it's just catching up with him.\"Through his legal counsel, Majors has denied these claims, as he did the previous initial claim, and insisted on his innocence.\"Jonathan Majors vehemently denies Rolling Stone's false allegations that he physically, verbally, or emotionally abused anyone, let alone any of his past romantic partners,\" Majors' attorney Dustin A. Pusch said. \"These allegations are based entirely on hearsay because neither of the romantic partners referenced were willing to engage with Rolling Stone for the article--demonstrating their outright falsity.\"This is where things get interesting: Majors' attorneys sent six statements from \"character witnesses\" who the actor dated or was close with. The legal team says that Rolling Stone chose to ignore these statements and went on with publication. Rolling Stone countered by saying it reached out to these witnesses, with three indicating they never gave permission to the legal team to release what they said. Another woman declined to share the statement credited to her by Majors' legal team as it was \"prewritten and untruthful.\" Another one did not respond to comment.\"It was pervasively known that he was [a good actor] and that he also would terrorize the people that he had dated,\" said another source. It's alleged by nine individual sources that Majors strangled one of these women and was both mentally and emotionally abusive toward her. His on-set behavior has also come into question as well. Claims of Majors being aggressive at work have surfaced, with two members of his recent production Magazine Dreams saying the actor pushed one person on set.

The trail of allegations goes back a decade to his time at Yale, which the young actor attended to study the dramatic arts. Rolling Stone spoke to over 20 anonymous sources about the actor's domestic abuse charge from March with charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment after a domestic dispute with a 30-year-old woman. These sources claim Majors has a history of abusive behavior throughout previous relationships.\"No one is surprised that this is coming out,\" one source stated. \"It always felt like it was a matter of time because his behavior never changed.","content_length":682,"content_tokens":130,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Jonathan Majors Has A Decade-Long History Of Abuse, New Report Alleges","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-has-a-decade-long-history-of-abuse-new-report-alleges/1100-6515604/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 7:51AM PDT","content":"He's kind of a bad dude, and now it's just catching up with him.\"Through his legal counsel, Majors has denied these claims, as he did the previous initial claim, and insisted on his innocence.\"Jonathan Majors vehemently denies Rolling Stone's false allegations that he physically, verbally, or emotionally abused anyone, let alone any of his past romantic partners,\" Majors' attorney Dustin A. Pusch said. \"These allegations are based entirely on hearsay because neither of the romantic partners referenced were willing to engage with Rolling Stone for the article--demonstrating their outright falsity.\"This is where things get interesting: Majors' attorneys sent six statements from \"character witnesses\" who the actor dated or was close with. The legal team says that Rolling Stone chose to ignore these statements and went on with publication. Rolling Stone countered by saying it reached out to these witnesses, with three indicating they never gave permission to the legal team to release what they said.","content_length":1010,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Jonathan Majors Has A Decade-Long History Of Abuse, New Report Alleges","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-has-a-decade-long-history-of-abuse-new-report-alleges/1100-6515604/","post_date":"June 30, 2023 at 7:51AM PDT","content":"Another woman declined to share the statement credited to her by Majors' legal team as it was \"prewritten and untruthful.\" Another one did not respond to comment.\"It was pervasively known that he was [a good actor] and that he also would terrorize the people that he had dated,\" said another source.

His enjoyment went deeper than simply seeing everything that it had to offer--he was so immersed that the world of Hallownest felt real to him in a way that no other game ever had. He was almost disappointed when he started his second playthrough and found that Hollow Knight's opening area, the Crossroads, had lost the magic. For the first time, he felt like he was navigating a 2D video game level, not an inhabited world.\"For this reason, Hollow Knight is my favorite game,\" Ccmaci says. \"I feel it is one of the best ever made, so much so I spent two years crafting my appreciation into something physical: a love letter in the form of Hallownest Vocalized.\"Hallownest Vocalized isn't the first attempt to bring voice acting to one of the biggest indie hits of the 2010s. In fact, he was inspired to start the project by a similar 2021 mod that fizzled out. The idea of it appealed to him so much that he decided to reboot the concept by putting out a casting call for the mod in August 2021, garnering more than 5,000 auditions in the process. Ccmaci says that a key moment in the project's development came early in the project, when he was still unsure if he was going to pursue it. While scouring the game's files for cut dialogue, he became fixated on the character Leg Eater. He sat there reading the NPC's lines, imagining his hunched form croaking out the words. That's when he knew that he wanted to create a mod for Hollow Knight that would capture the emotion of each speaker in a direct way, for even those who skipped the game's dialogue the first time around to appreciate. Hollow Knight is one of the most beloved indie games of the 2010s. The team of voice actors and programmers that contributed to Hallownest Vocalized are mostly hardcore fans of the game (but not all; the voice of Myla, Shaleah Wagner, has never actually played it), and many of them belong to its durable fan community, which is still going strong more than six years after its release. But though they all agreed to the project on a volunteer basis, they took their roles quite seriously. Because Hollow Knight's Simlish-esque nonsense language gives the player an idea of each character's existing voice and their vocal tone line-by-line, these actors already had a blueprint to follow for their roles and had to do their best to embody each character's personality without simply imitating them. They also had to match the cadence and tone that Ccmaci was looking for. For example, Hornet's voice actress, \"Alycoris,\" did a deep dive into the character's motivations and overall place in the land in order to portray the heroine, who is one of the most important in the game--as well as the protagonist of its sequel, Silksong.\"Hornet was by far the most difficult role,\" she says (having also performed a number of other roles). \"I did all kinds of character analysis on her to try and understand her better. She's a fierce character who is strong and puts up a harsh front. But out of everyone you meet in Hallownest, she's truly the only one who is looking for a future, and not an end. I tried my best to translate this feeling when I dubbed her.\"This same approach applies to characters who not every Hollow Knight player might remember, such as the Solaire-esque explorer Quirrel. Fan-favorite character Zote--a conceited knight whose confidence outstrips his apparent abilities--was voiced by a contributor who goes by the name \"Falconfetus8.\" Falcon says that he had significant problems recording all of Zote's many lines in the gravelly voice he adopted for the role, though he eventually recorded the Navy Seals copypasta in the voice just for fun. Quirrel's voice performer, James Weirich, was thrilled to play the role, stating that he deeply connected to the character on his first playthrough. Hollow Knight's sequel, Silksong, still doesn't have a firm release date.\"There's a particular scene in the game that always stood out to me: where you find Quirrel resting on a bench viewing the City of Tears from a high vantage point,\" Weirich says. \"The music, the artwork, Quirrel, and the sound of the rain... I sat next to him on the bench and really felt awe. I think it's instinctual for us to give voices to each character in our imaginations as we're reading text, whether it's a game, book, or even a silent film. My castmates did an amazing job, and I'm so damn proud to be among them.\"Given the success of Hallownest Vocalized, it's only natural to wonder if similar mods may eventually emerge for other big-name indie titles that lack English language voice acting. And though Ccmaci is considering such projects himself, he has a few words of advice for aspiring modders. For one, he recommends getting a team of audio engineers to help process the raw files. Initially, he wanted to find engineers who were familiar with Hollow Knight's story and characters, but he eventually decided to do it all himself, which he describes as a mistake. He also notes that modders should impose lenient due dates when working with unpaid volunteers. It is ultimately a hobby project, after all. As of this writing, Ccmaci has decided to wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong's release to decide whether or not to work on a hypothetical \"Pharloom Vocalized\" mod for the sequel. Given that we don't even have a release date for the game yet, this seems like a reasonable move. However, if he somehow had infinite money and time to burn, he would love to do a similar project for the Banner Saga series, which he describes as one of his favorites. At one point, he briefly considered trying to put together a Deltarune Vocalized project, but he decided against it, explaining that he hasn't spent enough time in that game's community to direct that project.\"Passion is the backbone of Hallownest Vocalized, passion built on years of soaking in the game's story and lore,\" he says. \"Without that, I would not have done right by Team Cherry. I hope that Hallownest Vocalized shows the fans of other games exactly that, and are inspired to spearhead their own love letters, knowing anyone can have the potential to do so.\"15 Best Metroidvania Games To Play In 2022See More","length":9440,"tokens":2198,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Meet The Team Behind Hollow Knight's Bewilderingly Ambitious Voice Mod","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-team-behind-hollow-knights-bewilderingly-ambitious-voice-mod/1100-6515606/","post_date":"July 2, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"The world of Hollow Knight, Hallownest, is one that lingers in the mind.

Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley is reported to have said during the court case that the new Call of Duty game coming this year will launch in November. That is no big surprise, as Call of Duty games typically release in the October/November period, but what's notable here is that Activision itself hasn't announced a release month so far. It's only said the game is coming this fall. The game, meanwhile, has not been officially announced--it's rumored to be Modern Warfare 3 from developer Sledgehammer Games. Judge Corley also stated during proceedings that COD 2023 will launch on PlayStation platforms, which is also no surprise. Even if Microsoft succeeds in acquiring Activision Blizzard, the Call of Duty series will stay on PlayStation and even potentially expand to Nintendo Switch.

The announcements included a new platform for Stray, a release date for Thirsty Suitors, and more details on the futuristic mech-western Bounty Stars. The biggest news of the presentation was a new Blade Runner game, with a moody trailer that evoked the feeling of the two films. You can check out all the announcements and trailers below. Lorelei and the Laser EyesThe first trailer was an update on Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. Presented like a paranoid thriller, the trailer had lots of cloak-and-dagger elements wrapped up in an enigmatic narrator. The trailer presented itself like a puzzle box, even ending with what appeared to be a cipher of some sort. CocoonThe next game from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlson is similarly spooky to those projects, with a new isometric perspective. The trailer was moody and evocative, and set a release date of September 29. Lushfoil Photography SimThis new game announcement was all about capturing picturesque, real-life landscapes. Though most of the trailer showed you walking through the landscapes in first-person, it also featured a classic camera viewfinder to express how you'll capture the world in photography.

FlockA multiplayer co-op game from the developers of Hohokum and I Am Dead, Flock is all about finding unusual animated birds and adding them to your avian group.

Thirsty SuitorsThe latest trailer for the dating adventure and skateboarding mashup Thirsty Suitors mostly recapped the story as we know it, as you try to navigate your love-life, your parents, and your relationship with your sister. The big reveal, though, was that it finally has a release date of November 2. Stray and Storyteller Coming to New PlatformsNew trailers for Stray and Storyteller revealed new platforms for each game. Stray will be coming to Xbox on August 10, as announced by a cute trailer featuring the kitty knocking over an Xbox controller.

Unavoidably seen in every round of Fortnite battle royale and Zero Build, the usually-blue bus has been reimagined in an official crossover with Hasbro toys. The reveal comes just weeks after Optimus Prime joined Fortnite as the tier 100 skin in the Chapter 4 Season 3 battle pass, and follows a typical pattern where Epic adds a licensed skin to its battle pass lineup, then sells a related skin in the item shop. The Battle Bus comes included in a pack with two other Transformers--Megatron and Bumblebee--and will be sold as a three-pack officially called the Fortnite Transformer Pack. Download cards will be sold in brick-and-mortar stores alongside digital codes that will be sold on game platforms and in the Fortnite item shop starting on October 13 for $25. No really, what happens to the bus driver?Gallery Each of the skins comes with additional accessories in the form of a related back bling and a pickaxe, and the bundle also includes 1,000 V-Bucks ($8). A typical release like this sold in the item shop would surely go for more than $25 for someone buying it all, and it wouldn't likely come with V-Bucks in return, so relative to the Fortnite norm, this is actually a bargain. Annually, Fortnite releases a major skins pack such as this in time for the holidays. It's one way a live-service game that gets no sequels can still bolster sales during the holiday shopping season. Previous packs have included characters like DC Comics villains Joker and Poison Ivy, and anime-themed reimaginings of some of the game's most adored characters, like Penny and Midas. While the Transformers crossover content will be otherwise over by the time this pack rolls out--Season 4 will kick off sometime in September--this skins pack gives fans of the iconic cartoon and toys another opportunity to see their favorite robots doing TikTok dances.

If you have a need for Microsoft Office, you're unlikely to find a better deal than the current offer. You can secure a lifetime license to Microsoft Office 2021 for just $30. Both the PC and Mac versions of Office are available at this price. On PC, you'll get Microsoft Office 2021 Professional, whereas Mac users will receive a key for the Home and Business edition. It's a particularly good deal for students and those who don't have much of a need for a consistently evolving productivity suite. These days, Microsoft Office is most commonly sold as a Microsoft 365 subscription. You'd actually spend more for one-year access to Microsoft 365 than you would by picking up Microsoft Office 2021. The best part is that once you redeem the key, the license is yours to keep. Microsoft Office 2021 Lifetime License $30 Buy it once, and you’ll have access to all the essential Microsoft apps forever without any pesky monthly fees. Keep in mind that you will only be able to install Microsoft Office on one computer. You will receive your install link that takes you to Microsoft's website to redeem your license key directly after finalizing your purchase.

You also only get the \"basic\" version of Teams with the Mac license. Considering that most users are buying Microsoft Office for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, these concessions probably aren't dealbreakers. It's worth noting that purchasing Microsoft Office 2021 means that you won't receive regular software updates that are offered to Microsoft 365 subscribers. Again, this likely isn't a huge deal for most people, as $30 is a bargain for even just Microsoft Word--and the 2021 version of Office is still excellent today.

Oppenheimer does have a much lower budget than Nolan's previous flick, Tenet, as Variety reports it was $100 million to make.

In case you missed out on one of these blockbusters, GameStop has a new deal on preowned Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch games where you can catch up on AAA releases and score one of those titles for free in the process. See all games at GameStop Currently, GameStop's buy two, get one free deal on preowned games is only available for PowerUp Rewards Pro members , but the special is expected to be available for everyone else later this week. As the sale name implies, you can buy two games from GameStop and get your third title for free. As for the games? Well, all preowned games are eligible, so you can search for whatever you want. That said, this sale is particularly noteworthy for the 2023 hits that GameStop has in stock. One such game is Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The return of Link has seen a huge evolution to the Hyrule sandbox that was established in 2017's Breath of the Wild, and combined with its deep gameplay mechanics, Tears of the Kingdom earned itself a rare 10/10 score when it first came out in May this year. Another game that you can add to your collection is Street Fighter 6, the latest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer to fighting games, the beauty of Street Fighter 6 is that it's the most accessible chapter in the franchise yet, as it balances clever control schemes with a vibrant cast of characters and a fun story mode. Sticking with Capcom, Resident Evil 4 got an impressive remake this year that expands on the ghoulish charm of the original game and adds some excellent quality-of-life changes. It's also a great-looking game that focuses on survival-action and has plenty of replayability once you finish its meaty campaign. For something grimmer, there's Diablo IV. This new chapter in Blizzard's series is a dark return to Sanctuary, and on console, it plays superbly with a controller as you deftly weave your special talents with hard-hitting melee attacks. Other highlights of the sale include Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Metroid Prime: Remastered, and Dead Space. It's worth noting that even if certain games are listed, it doesn't mean that they're available yet. You have to double-check each listing to make sure the game is available to ship. Still, this sale is a great chance to own some of the year's best games at a more affordable price and get one of your purchases for free in the process.

According to Bungie, players have encountered a problem with its key service called \"Claims,\" which is responsible for keeping the player and server in sync during every moment of their gameplay, as it routes \"every single kill, orb, or unit of Glimmer in Destiny 2\" to the correct recipient. While Lightfall saw several improvements made to the Claims service and to some of its underlying communication technology, issues around the service's error recovery functionality were later discovered and Bungie says that the updated system is not always recovering as expected in its live game environment. \"If these channels are permanently disrupted, this can be one of the causes behind Weasel, Baboon, or other error codes for a large subset of the player base,\" Bungie explained. Bungie's plan is to gradually roll out fixes, so as to avoid creating new issues or making stability worse for players. Ongoing support includes improvements to the production and deployment processes to reduce the risk of disruptions for players, and in a mid-season update, targeted improvements to logging and alerting systems will help the studio better identify issues that may arise. Season 22 will see a big update go live, and will see all manner of functionality tools tweaked, added, and improved upon. In Season 23, \"deeper and broader architectural improvements to improve the service stability\" to Destiny 2 will be added in that update and will include a range of additional improvements. You can see the full roadmap below of what to expect across the next couple of seasons. In other Destiny 2 news, a new Exotic quest that involves catching an Exotic fish has gone live, seemingly hinting at a powerful new weapon being added to the game this season, and after this week's major revelation about The Witness, Bungie has pledged to credit and compensate an artist whose work was referenced in a recent cutscene. Destiny ongoing stability fixesWe will continue to make improvements to our production and deployment processes to reduce the risk of disruptions for players while reducing our maintenance and deployment downtime windows. We will also constantly improve our response procedures for incident recovery to bring Destiny 2 back online as quickly as possible when incidents occur. This work has been ongoing and will continue throughout this timeline. Mid-Season 21 updateWe will make targeted improvements to our logging and alerting systems, allowing us to diagnose issues more quickly with Claims and related systems. These changes are designed to minimize the risk of further degrading stability, while helping us to confirm the effectiveness of fixes further out on the roadmap. Season 22 launch updateWe are deploying a large set of improvements meant to improve the “self-healing” ability of Claims and reduce the odds of us needing to bring Destiny 2 temporarily offline when an issue occurs. We are adding functionality for services to detect Claims services that are in an unhealthy state and send their messages to healthy services instead. We are additionally making six targeted fixes to Claims systems where we have identified issues that could impact Claims stability or recovery. We are making an improvement to better evict old gameplay messages in our pipelines, which should help with faster recoveries and reduce the chance of a “death spiral” of slow messages causing more slow messages. We are also deploying improvements that will help us to make Destiny 2 services even more robust in the future. We are adding improved support for targeted “Chaos Testing” against our services, allowing us to better simulate different failure modes for our services. We are adding more logging for non-Claims portions of our messaging pipelines to detect other issues that could lead to connection problems for players. Finally, to reduce the odds of introducing new problems with these changes, we are also updating and expanding our Claims Unit Tests. This is automated testing that verifies code is behaving the way we expect it should. Season 23 launch updateBased on the results of our 7.2.0 updates and improved logging, we will be targeting deeper and broader architectural improvements to improve the service stability and rapid recovery of Destiny 2, which will include a range of additional improvements.

According to Bungie, players have encountered a problem with its key service called \"Claims,\" which is responsible for keeping the player and server in sync during every moment of their gameplay, as it routes \"every single kill, orb, or unit of Glimmer in Destiny 2\" to the correct recipient. While Lightfall saw several improvements made to the Claims service and to some of its underlying communication technology, issues around the service's error recovery functionality were later discovered and Bungie says that the updated system is not always recovering as expected in its live game environment. \"If these channels are permanently disrupted, this can be one of the causes behind Weasel, Baboon, or other error codes for a large subset of the player base,\" Bungie explained.","content_length":991,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Destiny 2 Server Stability Fixes Will Roll Out Across Season 22 And 23","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-stability-fixes-will-roll-out-across-season-22-and-23/1100-6515585/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 12:56PM PDT","content":"Bungie's plan is to gradually roll out fixes, so as to avoid creating new issues or making stability worse for players.

Mangold stated that the studio shifted its focus away from films like his Boba Fett project and toward the opportunities presented by streaming platforms. Reflecting on his time writing the Star Wars script, Mangold described it as a \"beautiful period\" in his life, where he immersed himself in the work while listening to Ennio Morricone's music. \"But I'm not sure it ever would've happened,\" Mangold said. \"I'm not sure it was in anyone's plans, what I was thinking about.\"While his Boba Fett project didn't come to fruition, Mangold has another opportunity to contribute to the Star Wars universe.

Mangold's newest movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, is set to premiere on June 30.

The Warcraft and Overwatch company has announced more details about BlizzCon 2023, including ticket prices and an overview of what attendees can expect. Starting with ticket prices, fans can get in for $300 USD for a general admission ticket. A Portal Pass includes all general admission perks and much more--for the price of $800. GA tickets include access to all halls, early access to the BlizzCon Store, in-game content, and an backpack. People who buy the Portal Pass get all that plus access to a private lounge featuring meet-and-greets, as well as separate registration and security lines. These premium tickets also get people in earlier than everyone else. Tickets will go on sale in July across two waves. Wave 1 goes live on Saturday, July 8, starting at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET through AXS. The second wave opens on Saturday, July 22, at the same time. People can purchase a maximum of two tickets per order. Tickets go on sale this JulyNo comparison is perfect, complete, or strictly fair, but tickets for BlizzCon 2019--the last in-person BlizzCon event--started at $230. The Portal Pass that year was $550. People staying home can watch for free, but a Virtual Ticket will also be available that comes with in-game content, early access to merch, and more to be announced later. Pricing for the Virtual Ticket was not announced. BlizzCon 2023 takes place November 3-4 in Anaheim, California. For 2023, Blizzard said the aim is to make the event \"more experiential than ever before.\" Fans can expect \"massive installations, art, and thematic spaces\" featuring franchises like Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. Attendees can also attend developer panels and learn about upcoming Blizzard projects. The first Overwatch World Cup will take place at BlizzCon as well. The show historically includes a performance by a major band, too. Previous performers have included The Offspring, Metallica, Muse, Blink 182, and Ozzy Osbourne. Blizzard has not announced if there will be a concert at BlizzCon 2023. In a change from previous years, all panels, the Community Night, and the Opening Ceremony will take place in the BlizzCon Arena (though the Opening Ceremony will be available to watch on all screens in the convention center).

But that deal doesn't cover other football games, even those using active NFL players, such as the newly announced Wild Card Football. Starring Colin Kaepernick and a host of active players such as Nick Chubb, TJ Watt, and Aaron Donald, Wild Card Football is, in everything but name, the football analog to Saber Interactive's NBA Playgrounds and NFL Battlegrounds. It's even billed as being part of the Playground Sports franchise, making it the third sports or sports entertainment brand to get the arcade gameplay treatment from Saber. Wild Card Football takes advantage of an NFLPA licensing deal, but not the league itself, so real team names and logos won't be featured. Still, the game boasts \"hundreds\" of NFL players on its roster, and it's up to players to form their own rosters, Backyard Sports-style.

Being a part of the Playground Sports franchise, it's interesting to see 2K is not attached, as it previously published the sequel to NBA Playgrounds, even tweaking its name to NBA 2K Playgrounds 2. A representative for the game told GameSpot that Saber owns the Playground Sports series and 2K's involvement with past games in the series was merely a publishing agreement, not a change of IP ownership.

The newest mitigation technique is called \"Hallucinations,\" and here's how it works. With Hallucinations, \"decoy characters\" are deployed in the game environment. They can only be seen by players believed to be cheating, and they do not impact a legitimate player's experience in any way, Activision said in a blog post. Instead, they \"serve to disorient cheaters in a variety of ways,\" Activision said. \"Hallucinations can be deployed both as a method of mitigation for verified cheaters or, in secret, as a detection for suspicious players.\"The new Hallucination mitigation feature in Call of Duty As a mitigation technique, Hallucination-based soldiers look, move, and act like a real human player, Activision said. They aren't AI, but instead a clone of an active user in a match, with the aim being to trick a cheater into thinking they are squaring off against another human.\"Hallucinations also trigger the same information that cheaters would have access to using nefarious tools, revealing unique data to make them appear legitimate,\" Activision said. Hallucinations can also be used for the purpose of detecting cheaters. As an example, Activision could deploy a Hallucination character close to a person believed to be cheating. A player who engages with a Hallucination character will then reveal themselves to be a cheater. Activision said one of the aims of creating the new Hallucination technique is to target \"non-rage\" hackers, or those who cheat by way of using software that gives them access to other in-game information in real time that provides an unfair advantage. An in-depth whitepaper on Call of Duty Hallucinations is available on Activision's website. While Activision is rolling out Hallucinations, it is removing a different cheating mitigation feature: Quicksand. This slowed or froze the movement of cheaters, making them easy targets. However, Activision is removing it now because it could be \"very visually jarring to anyone in the lobby.\" Activision said Quicksand is now back on the shelf but it could return one day. Also in the blog post, Activision said the system it launched in April that could detect third-party cheating hardware has proven to be successful in an effort to go after cheaters in Call of Duty.\"Within the first two weeks of launching this detection we saw a 59% drop in any use of these devices across Modern Warfare II and Warzone--inclusive of MWII Ranked Play (Warzone Ranked had not launched within this window). Of those users, 57% of them did not utilize the device again, whereas 43% once again attempted to circumvent the policy,\" Activision said. What's more, Activision said the in-game reporting systems for Call of Duty have been expanded upon to include \"Malicious Reporting.\" Players who knowingly submit false reports could now face warnings or account suspensions. Additionally, some automated penalties like feature restrictions and voice/text restrictions, have been disabled for the time being.

An in-depth whitepaper on Call of Duty Hallucinations is available on Activision's website.","content_length":962,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Call Of Duty Launches New Way To Thwart Cheaters, And It Involves Hallucinations","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-launches-new-way-to-thwart-cheaters-and-it-involves-hallucinations/1100-6515582/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 11:30AM PDT","content":"While Activision is rolling out Hallucinations, it is removing a different cheating mitigation feature: Quicksand. This slowed or froze the movement of cheaters, making them easy targets. However, Activision is removing it now because it could be \"very visually jarring to anyone in the lobby.\" Activision said Quicksand is now back on the shelf but it could return one day. Also in the blog post, Activision said the system it launched in April that could detect third-party cheating hardware has proven to be successful in an effort to go after cheaters in Call of Duty.\"Within the first two weeks of launching this detection we saw a 59% drop in any use of these devices across Modern Warfare II and Warzone--inclusive of MWII Ranked Play (Warzone Ranked had not launched within this window) Of those users, 57% of them did not utilize the device again, whereas 43% once again attempted to circumvent the policy,\" Activision said. What's more, Activision said the in-game reporting systems for Call of Duty have been expanded upon to include \"Malicious Reporting.\" Players who knowingly submit false reports could now face warnings or account suspensions. Additionally, some automated penalties like feature restrictions and voice/text restrictions, have been disabled for the time being.

The company's boss, John Hanke, notified staffers of a drastic change to the company's organization and outlook that includes layoffs, a studio closure, and game cancellations. Niantic is closing its Los Angeles studio and making cuts to the company's headcount at other offices. Additionally, NBA All-World is going offline and the upcoming game Marvel: World of Heroes is now canceled. In total, Niantic is cutting about 230 jobs. In an email from Hanke shared on Niantic's website, the executive wrote that the \"difficult changes\" are needed to help the company \"weather the current challenges in the market and take advantage of the long term opportunity in front of us.\"Going forward, Niantic will narrow its focus and concentrate on first-party titles that \"most strongly embody\" the company's core values.\"The mobile gaming market is very mature and only the best and most differentiated titles have a chance to succeed. We also want to increase our focus on building for the emerging class of MR devices and future AR glasses,\" he said, referring to mixed-reality and augmented-reality. Hanke said these changes are the result of Niantic spending more than it is earning back in revenue. Like other companies, Niantic saw a surge in revenue during Covid, and the company staffed up and spent more to \"pursue growth more aggressively.\" But now, Hanke said revenue at Niantic has returned to pre-Covid levels and the new games that the company launched \"have not delivered revenues commensurate with those investments.\"The changes announced today will \"bring expenses and revenue back into line while preserving our core assets and long term upside,\" Hanke said. Hanke went on to cite the \"overall global macroeconomic slowdown\" as a reason for the layoffs, along with what he said were \"unique challenges\" in the increasingly crowded mobile market. Additionally, Hanke said the AR market is not taking off as fast as the company imagined.\"Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation. It also requires strong monetization and a social core which can drive viral growth and long term engagement,\" he said. \"Teams need platform tools that are force multipliers, enabling them to build at the highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently. Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust and reliable way. We have not met our goals in all of these areas.\"Hanke said Niantic remains a believed in AR as the \"future form factor for computing\" and that Apple's recent announcement of the Apple Vision Pro validates this thinking. In the immediate future, Hanke said Niantic's main priority is to keep Pokemon Go on a healthy trajectory. Hanke said Pokemon Go is a \"forever game,\" adding that it continues to invest more in the product and team behind Pokemon Go, though it also made \"some adjustments\" to the team. Hanke added that he feels confident about the future of Pikmin Bloom, Peridot, and Monster Hunter Now. Finally, Hanke said the culture inside Niantic is changing as a result to become a \"more direct and results-based\" company.\"The leadership team and I are committed to cutting out unnecessary processes, duplicate lines of authority, and unclear decision making,\" Hanke said. Previously in 2023, Embracer announced major layoffs and game cancellations, Firaxis cut jobs, and Relic eliminated positions. Other companies that have cut staff this year have included The Molasses Flood, Unity, Ready at Dawn, Take-Two, Xbox, Ubisoft, and more.","length":3691,"tokens":761,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Pokemon Go Dev Cancels Marvel Game, Lays Off 230 People","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 10:42AM PDT","content":"Pokemon Go developer Niantic has become the latest major game studio to announce serious layoffs and other significant changes.

But we decided that there was a ceiling that we couldn't break if we did not deliver something fresh, something new.\"Now, Bloober is ready to try something different. \"We decided that our next titles should be much more mass-market oriented,\" Babieno said. \"We'd like to talk with more people. We'd like to deliver our ideas, with our DNA, not by environment or storytelling, but by action. So all of our future titles will have a lot of gameplay mechanics. They will be much bigger.\"It wasn't just Layers of Fear that exemplified this now-past version of the studio. Virtually all of its games since 2016 have been of the \"walking sim\" mold, from Observer and Blair Witch to Layers of Fear 2 and The Medium, the latter of which came closest to having gameplay elements that go beyond simply moving through a world, interacting with light puzzles, and maybe occasionally dodging actual unscripted threats. Game-over screens have been rare in Bloober Team's games to date, as they've played more like A-to-B horror museums rather than survival-horror games, but that trend will likely come to an abrupt end with the launch of the Silent Hill 2 remake, to which it's been given the reins by Konami, though no release date has yet been revealed. Beyond the lofty remake project, horror games will continue to be the focus for the studio, Babieno said, even as the studio reimagines itself for a second time. \"I would like to deliver some new milestones of horror, our niche.\"","length":4328,"tokens":1094,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Silent Hill 2 Remake Studio Says It's Done Making \"Walking Sim\" Horror Games","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-says-its-done-making-walking-sim-horror-games/1100-6515580/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 10:13AM PDT","content":"Bloober Team, the Polish studio famous for games such as Layers of Fear, The Medium, and the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, said it will no longer make the sort of psychological \"walking simulator\" horror games it's largely focused on to date.

Game-over screens have been rare in Bloober Team's games to date, as they've played more like A-to-B horror museums rather than survival-horror games, but that trend will likely come to an abrupt end with the launch of the Silent Hill 2 remake, to which it's been given the reins by Konami, though no release date has yet been revealed.

Additionally, Larian said the PC edition of Baldur's Gate 3 will launch \"at a time where you'll have more time to play it,\" which sounds like a reference to Starfield and how that game is expected to take up time and attention for PC gamers. Baldur's Gate 3 is coming soonFor the PS5 edition, Larian said it needs more time to get Baldur's Gate 3 running at 60fps. It doesn't want to compromise, so it's delaying the game until it's ready.\"Baldur's Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames per second and we're close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time,\" the studio said. \"We don't want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"Larian added: \"We understand that folks may be disappointed with this but we're close enough to reaching new heights for RPGs on the system that the benefits of a short delay outweigh the downsides of rushing the PS5 release and having to downscale.\"An Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 could still happen, but as Larian has said before, the technical limitations of the Series S appear to be holding things back. Larian said it's \"optimistic\" about putting the game on Xbox Series X, but the developer wants to ensure the game performs \"without compromise\" across the Series X|S ecosystem together.\"We already put a lot of effort into making it work and will continue to do so. Like with the PS5 version, we'll release it when it's ready. We'll update you as soon as we can,\" Larian said. Additionally, Larian said the \"full\" Mac version of Baldur's Gate 3 is in development and will be released \"at a later date.\"\"We've always been a studio that aims to release on as many platforms as possible, in order of readiness. We've also aimed for the highest possible quality on every platform we've released on,\" Larian publishing boss Michael Douse said. \"We're at a point where we’re reaching 60fps on PlayStation 5, which is remarkable considering the breadth and depth Baldur's Gate 3 aims for. It features over 170 hours of cinematics, more than twice the length of the entirety of Game of Thrones, and more than three times the dialogue of all three Lord of the Rings novels combined.\"\"Reaching a technical bar that matches our design ambitions felt like the right move, while holding back the PC version when we knew we'd be ready felt like the wrong move in such a busy launch period,\" Douse added.

Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (sometimes two or three, though!). All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication to start snagging freebies. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings. Current free game at Epic From now until July 6 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, you can claim The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos, a humorous tactical RPG created by French author John Lang. Prior to the game's release in 2020, Nahuelbeuk was an audio comedy program that parodied fantasy tropes. Next free game at Epic Starting July 6, you can claim Grime: Colors of Rot, a challenging metroidvania that originally released in 2021. Epic has great timing on this freebie, as the free Tinge of Terror DLC launched a few weeks ago. If you're up for the challenge, Tinge of Terror adds a cool New Game+ mode. All metroidvania fans owe it to themselves to try Grime. See all free games at Epic Epic Games Store free games listWe're keeping a running list of every free game that Epic users have been able to claim in the past. From AAA hits to indie darlings, Epic has really made its mark with free games. You can even snag these games if you don't have a powerful PC so you can play them if you ever get one.

Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (sometimes two or three, though!) All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication to start snagging freebies. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.

Next free game at Epic Starting July 6, you can claim Grime: Colors of Rot, a challenging metroidvania that originally released in 2021. Epic has great timing on this freebie, as the free Tinge of Terror DLC launched a few weeks ago. If you're up for the challenge, Tinge of Terror adds a cool New Game+ mode. All metroidvania fans owe it to themselves to try Grime.

From AAA hits to indie darlings, Epic has really made its mark with free games. You can even snag these games if you don't have a powerful PC so you can play them if you ever get one.

And there are some layers of complexity, such as bait, a Focused Fishing meter, and shifting locations of fishing ponds to account for, which we break down below. Fishing is also a key component of a new secret Exotic quest. How does fishing work in Destiny 2?Fishing is a fairly straightforward activity in Destiny 2, provided you know where to go (more on that below). You'll need to advance through the opening portion of the Season of the Deep questline, at which point you'll get a quest from Hawthorne to go fishing. Fishing ponds appear almost like public events on three destinations--Nessus, the EDZ, and the Throne World--and you'll often see other players congregate on the makeshift docks that emerge when these ponds are active. To fish, you simply stand on the dock and hold your Interact button/key to cast a line into the water. When a fish eventually grabs on, you'll see your lure go under the water and a message will appear. Press Interact again--ideally the instant the message pops up in order to secure a \"perfect catch.\" Even if you don't time that correctly, you can still reel in your catch, though wait too long and you'll get nothing. Be sure to actually pick up the fish you catch--they'll be laying on the ground around you, and you'll need to walk over them to collect them. (Sadly, the Shoot to Loot perk won't grab them for you.) Fish can have different weights, with larger ones (those 18kg and above) progressing a particular Triumph, We're Gonna Need a Bigger Tank. Catching fish more generally will also contribute toward a Week 1 seasonal challenge, The One That Didn't Get Away. Where are fishing pond locations in Destiny 2?A fishing pond on NessusFishing ponds are perhaps the most confusing aspect of fishing when you first get started, as ponds are not always available, and they are not always in the same exact spots. There are three destinations with fishing ponds: The Cistern on Nessus, the Outskirts on the EDZ, and Miasma on the Throne World. But these function sort of like public events, with fishing ponds periodically spawning and then disappearing after some period of time, often when a nearby public event begins. Although there is a marker on the map for each destination, this won't guide you to the exact location of a fishing pond, assuming there is one currently available. Instead, you'll need to explore the area to find one:On the EDZ, somewhere along the southern coast of the OutskirtsOn Nessus, in the Radiolarian fluid in The Cistern, east of the Well of FlameOn the Throne World, on the northern coast of MiasmaFortunately, there is a relatively easy way to spot these fishing ponds: Look for a beam of light being emitted into the sky. You should be able to see this from a fair distance away, signaling the presence of a fishing pond on the ground below it. How does bait work?Although you can fish without bait, bait is needed in order to be eligible to catch higher-rarity fish (effectively preventing you from grinding indefinitely). Bait will automatically be used when fishing, provided you have any on hand. You can check on how much you have by looking at the on-screen message that pops up before casting your lure, or by hovering over the Fishing Tackle item in your inventory. You can hold a maximum of 500 bait at a time. Bait is earned from completing various activities--the new Salvage and Deep Dive modes, for instance, as well as patrols, public events, and playlist activities like Crucible and Gambit--or by collecting destination materials. How does Focused Fishing work?Fishing on the EDZFishing with a higher-level Focused Fishing buff increases your likelihood of catching higher-rarity fish, including the Exotic fish you need to get Broken Blades. The Focused Fish meter can be seen on the left side of the screen while near a pond. By catching legendary or Exotic fish, this meter will increase. All nearby players' catches will contribute to your meter, even if they aren't in your fireteam. This means you ideally want to be fishing at a pond with multiple other players, and you'll want to do so for as long as possible, as the meter will reset when the pond despawns, even if you don't leave the destination and wait for another pond to appear. You don't have to be present the entire time to benefit from Focused Fishing, as the buff is tied to that fishing location. Reaching each of the increments will boost your chances of rarer fish, and you'll see messages like, \"Nearby fish have begun to take notice\" to denote your progress. Destiny 2 fishing rewardsAs with the amount of bait you're carrying, you can check on how many fish you've collected--and their rarity--by hovering over the Fishing Tackle in your inventory. You can carry a maximum of 500 fish at a time. At any time, you can head to the nearly opened wing of the HELM to release your fish into the aquarium, which is done with a hilarious, Gambit-dunk-style flourish. This is how you receive rewards for your time spent fishing, as depositing fish will get you glimmer, Sonar Station reputation, and--in the case of legendary or Exotic fish--actual weapons and items, including the new Just in Case legendary sword. Fish you deposit will then appear in the aquarium, alongside various other themed items from the game's past. There are numerous Triumphs to complete related to fishing, with some unlocking additional decorations for your aquarium.","length":5761,"tokens":1249,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Destiny 2 Fishing Guide: Pond Locations, Focused Fishing, And Rewards","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-fishing-guide-pond-locations-focused-fishing-and-rewards/1100-6514504/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 7:57AM PDT","content":"Destiny 2: Season of the Deep is water-themed, and one of its most notable additions is a very unexpected one: fishing.

Others are far more secretive and hidden, including one that appears to have been added just recently but is seemingly not yet available in full. This new Exotic quest involves catching an Exotic fish, something called a Broken Blade, and those mysterious Deep Dive statues. While we don't yet know all the details--or even what the reward is--below we've outlined what we have figured out, such as how to get started on this new quest, which appears to be time-gated, as we have a new development as of the June 27 reset. How to start: catch an Exotic fishAt least to start, you won't see anything in your quest log about a new Exotic to acquire. Instead, you simply need to know that this quest exists and go about acquiring an Exotic fish. Make sure to grab the Fishing Rally quest from Hawthorne at the Tower, too, since you'll be doing a lot of fishing and can make progress on that simultaneously. This is a new quest that was introduced on June 20, coinciding with this Exotic quest. You can consult our Destiny 2 fishing guide for more details on how fishing works if you haven't done any yet, but it appears you'll want to start by fishing on the Throne World, where you can get the Whispering Mothcarp. You can also now catch an Exotic on Nessus--the Vexing Palcoderm--which is also required for another step of this hidden quest. Unfortunately, catching an Exotic fish is a crapshoot: Some players have reportedly caught hundreds of fish without one, while others get one much sooner. I was able to head to the Throne World and catch one within 10-15 minutes, but your miles may very much vary. This is where the Focused Fishing buff can help, so be sure to stick with the same fishing pond for as long as possible (and hopefully with as many other people as possible) to build up the Focused Fishing meter to improve your odds of catching an Exotic. Release the Exotic fish at the HELMOnce you have your Whispering Mothcarp and/or Vexing Placoderm in hand, head to the HELM and dunk it into the aquarium as per usual. Alongside the typical rewards for catching an Exotic fish--including a piece of Exotic gear--you'll also receive something called a Broken Blade. This, too, does not give you a quest, nor does it directly show up in your inventory, making it easy to miss if you don't see the pop-up when you first acquire it. Check your Fishing Tackle to confirm you have a Broken Blade. Instead, you can see that you have a Broken Blade by hovering over the Fishing Tackle in your inventory; it will say that a Broken Blade has been acquired from Savathun's throne world. That suggests similar ones can be acquired from Nessus and the EDZ, but for now, head into a Deep Dive activity. Deposit the Broken Blade in a Deep DiveIf you've been playing Deep Dives, you may have noticed some conspicuous-looking Hive statues that you haven't been able to do anything with. Now, with a Broken Blade in hand, you can deposit the item at one of these statues by approaching it and holding Use to offer the item up. This will prompt some dialogue from Xivu Arath, and flames will appear on the statue. The first statue is located in the first underwater section, after you open the door. Drop down, and rather than proceeding as usual to the first cliff you can drop off of, head toward the right, where you'll proceed down a small hallway-like corridor. At the end is a drop, where you'll immediately be able to see the statue. The second statue comes after successfully completing the first combat encounter. When that's done, head to the outside area, in the direction of where you'd select your next buff. Head toward the left and look for a newly opened door up on a second-floor platform. Just inside on the right is the next statue. With the Broken Blade offered up to these statues, there appears to be nothing else to do at the time of this writing. It seems likely that next week, a new Exotic fish will become available on the EDZ and Nessus, which will in turn provide Broken Blades to offer to the other Hive statues. Where things go from there, however, is anyone's guess.","length":4201,"tokens":933,"chunks":[{"post_title":"How To Start Destiny 2's New Exotic Fish And Broken Blade Exotic Quest","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-exotic-fish-broken-blade-new-exotic-quest/1100-6515481/","post_date":"June 29, 2023 at 7:44AM PDT","content":"Some of Destiny 2's Exotic quests are clearly telegraphed and presented in a way that makes them hard to miss.

That's a massive 93% discount, making this an excellent value. See at Fanatical The seven indie games on offer include the recently-released Hand of Doom, a satirical dark fantasy RPG that mixes first-person dungeon-crawling gameplay with live-action FMV humor and a heavy metal soundtrack. For more old-school RPG goodness, there's also The Chronicles of Nyanya, a quirky RPG set in a fantasy world populated by talking felines with gameplay inspired by turn-based classics like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. If you're into rogue-likes, there's Sea Horizon, a deck-building RPG with turn-based combat where you travel and battle across a giant archipelago. The bundle also includes a couple of 2D platformers. There's Onde, a puzzle platformer with gorgeous hand-drawn artwork, and Bots are Stupid, which is a challenging skill-based platformer with over 40 levels and the ability to create and share your own stages. Then there's Suffer the Night, a first-person survival horror game with campy '80s slasher vibes where you're stuck in a remote cabin filled with deadly traps, monsters that stalk you, and otherworldly mysteries to uncover. Lastly, there's Landlord's Super, a construction and life management sim set in the UK during the economic strife of the 1980s. Players use detailed construction systems to build their own settlements and can explore the open world filled with side characters.

July is a strong month for PlayStation Plus free games, as subscribers can grab Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Endling - Extinction is Forever, and Alan Wake Remastered. The July PS Plus lineup goes live on Tuesday, July 4. Alan Wake Remastered is particularly timely, as Alan Wake II is set to launch October 17 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. If you've never played the original game, the 2021 remaster is definitely worth checking out. The action-adventure follows the eponymous thriller novelist's search for his missing wife while on vacation in a curious little town. Though the original game only dabbles with horror, the sequel looks like a straight-up horror game. Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of Alan Wake Remastered will be up for grabs. PS Plus subscribers will also be able to check out Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, the 2020 entry in the first-person shooter franchise. Cold War is the latest iteration of the Black Ops sub-series from Treyarch and Raven Software. Its campaign is (unsurprisingly) set during the 1980s, and it has a full online multiplayer suite as well as Zombies mode. The freebie will be the Cross-Gen bundle, which means the PS5 and PS4 versions are included. The final free game for July isn't as well-known as the other two, but it has a great reputation. Endling - Extinction is Forever places you in the role of the last mother fox in the world. Your job is to avoid extinction in a harsh environment. Endling released last summer and currently holds an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" user rating average on Steam. The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and you won't have to invest too much time to complete it. The adventure has a runtime of around five hours. All PlayStation Plus subscribers, regardless of tier, will be able to claim the free games for July. In the meantime, make sure to grab June's PS Plus freebies if you haven't already.

The sequel continued the original's themes of tortured artists, but swapped a painter for an actor, and offered arguably even more inventive visuals. Both games were, in my opinion, fine, but nothing more. Now, reborn on Unreal Engine 5 with new content interspersed with what was there before, Layers of Fear (2023) looks to be the definitive way to experience the horror series. However, its haunts remain largely empty. The new engine makes the game a visual benchmark, but it still feels more like a haunted house at a theme park, offering the illusion of danger but never something sincerely threatening. Perhaps the first hurdle in critiquing the series' reinvention is explaining exactly what this package offers. Layers of Fear and its sequel both return roughly 80% the same as you may have experienced them before. Some scenes have been redesigned or added--or even removed, if my memory serves me correctly. Both games receive new but ultimately shallow mechanics allowing for a few combat sections in which you'll need to blast stalking ghosts with light to stall them while you escape their maze-like settings. The first game's brief Inheritance DLC is also included, and a brand-new DLC meant to wrap the series up more neatly than before, The Final Note, makes its debut. The best part of all of this is actually the framing narrative, The Writer's Story. Built directly into the game as you progress through its connected parts, you'll routinely jump back to a lighthouse where a writer tells the story of the game's other haunted artists: the painter, the actor, and the musician. Like those in the main games, the writer is dealing with her own hauntings, and I find the format classy and quite novel for the medium. It feels like a horror anthology, such as V/H/S, only in this case, all the individual stories ultimately share a universe. Light combat elements have been added to address past complaints, but they don't add much to the games. This delivery is compelling, but it has the odd effect of making each individual piece more of a letdown, as they largely struggle to hold up on their own. Layers of Fear has always been more like an amusement park ride than a survival-horror experience, and that MO just doesn't feel conducive to generating actual tension. Even in these new versions--which try to add more possible game-over screens--moments are too scripted and enemies are basically non-existent. The novelty of entering a room, seeing something weird happen, then turning to find the environment has seamlessly changed before you is occasionally mind-melting, but never, ever scary. The first game also feels desperate to avoid being misunderstood, to the point where its story is laid out so bare, it betrays the adage of \"show, don't tell\" at every turn. The Final Note DLC seeks to over-explain even more by putting you in the role of the one person you never play as in the original or its Inheritance DLC. Inheritance also winds up being mechanically frustrating due to some confusing puzzles, but its intent to show the world through the eyes of a child make it more memorable than anything the other pieces do, unless you count the new DLC's broken enemy encounters, during which the ghost chasing me get stuck halfway in the floorboards. The highlight is certainly Layers of Fear 2, which does more with its setting and story than the rest of the series combined. Unlike the needlessly overt original, the sequel is perhaps too shrouded in metaphor at times, though it does make piecing it all together more interesting. For those who never played the original Layers of Fear games, this reimagined package is definitely a better first experience than the old versionsWhile the other games all take place in endless darkness, Layers of Fear 2 is set aboard a cruise ship where a movie was to be filmed, and it's not afraid to turn the lights on at times, constantly toying with different palettes and scenery. It winds up more memorable than the original's house, which feels the same room to room, albeit with some nightmarish scenes of its own to play off of. The story is at once a twisted tale of method acting, a dark tragedy, and a nearly constant homage to horror's past, with nods to The Shining, Psycho, and more laid out like displays in a horror museum. It's all narrated by actor Tony Todd too, who makes a great fit given the tenor of his voice, particularly if you're familiar with his body of work like Candyman and Final Destination. Still, not even Layers of Fear 2 can break free of the series' shackles. Gameplay across the series largely comes down to walking, opening doors, and seeing what weird scene awaits on the other side. Some light puzzles mix up the pacing, but the new chase sequences feel one-note, many of them even using the same dialogue lines time after time. To its credit, this new edition is built on Unreal Engine 5 and seems to utilize the new Lumen lighting technology, which makes games like Fortnite so jaw-dropping to look at. Here, the colors are naturally not as bright as Epic's cartoonish battle royale, but the lighting tech is dazzling nonetheless. I stopped in my tracks many times across the 10-12 hours it takes to finish all five experiences simply because the game looks amazing. With a best-in-series story and more visual variety, Layers of Fear 2 remains the series' high point. It's just too bad it rarely does more than that. Before, Layers of Fear offered some stunning scenes and a moody atmosphere. Now, nearly a decade later, the game somehow reinvents itself but adds very few new strengths, while its weaknesses only stand out more due to the effort that went into justifying the project in the first place. It feels like the studio heard the complaint of a lack of true threats in the games, but in seeking to polish out that blemish, just left more faults. For those who never played the original Layers of Fear games, this reimagined package is definitely a better first experience than the old versions, simply on account of looking better and adding the neat framing narrative of The Writer's Story. But for horror enthusiasts already well-versed in the series, its MO remains as smoke and mirrors. There are no real terrors lurking in the shadows just out of reach. There is only the suggestion of some, and like the many tortured artists at the center of its saga, they are left unfulfilled.","length":6591,"tokens":1374,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Layers Of Fear (2023) Review - Delusions Of Grandeur","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/layers-of-fear-2023-review-delusions-of-grandeur/1900-6418080/","post_date":"June 15, 2023 at 9:00AM PDT","content":"Bloober Team's original Layers of Fear (2016) became an almost overnight gaming sensation when its mind-bending Steam Early Access version gave players some truly imaginative sights.

In another, I'm walking a fully customized avatar through a bustling city, its streets lined with AI-controlled strangers I can challenge to battle at my leisure. In a third, that same avatar is dropped into a massive room filled with arcade cabinets and other players looking for a fight. Street Fighter 6 learns an immediate lesson from the content-bare release of its predecessor, as it offers a variety of significant features and modes right out of the gate. It is a robust fighting game that is of premiere quality. Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned pros. SF6 splits its content into three hubs: Fighting Ground, which most closely emulates the classic SF experience; Battle Hub, where players can congregate to challenge each other and compete in tournaments; and World Tour, which is a sprawling, globe-trotting story mode with an open world and RPG hooks. Each format centers around the classic Street Fighter style of 2D fighting gameplay, and that excellent core experience is what drives everything. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Some have an in-your-face style with heavy strikes and damaging throws, while others are better suited to keeping their distance and picking moments to strike. What distinguishes SF6 from previous iterations are the core universal mechanics shared by all characters. While the effects and execution are the same for each fighter, these mechanics have their own distinct flair and flourish of personality depending on the character you choose. These universal mechanics are also where much of Street Fighter 6's gameplay depth is. The Drive system is SF6's new universal battle mechanic, and I'm amazed at how much it adds to a match despite being simple to grasp. By pressing the two medium attack buttons, I can parry an attack using Drive Parry, or, with Drive Rush, I can immediately dash forward out of it for a burst of speed that can catch opponents off guard or introduce new combo sequences. Functionally, players that are experienced with Street Fighter 4's Focus Attack Dash Cancel or Guilty Gear's Roman Cancels will feel right at home. By pressing both heavy attacks, I can initiate a Drive Impact that can stagger an opponent and leave them open, ensuring that overly defensive players can be opened up. If an opponent is backed into a corner, landing this will make them bounce off the wall, adding a variety of other strategic considerations and opportunities. Drive Reversals, meanwhile, allow me to block an attack and counter with a move that, while not very damaging, will help escape tricky spots. Finally, Overdrive lets me power up special attacks like the EX systems of old. These aren't unlimited, however, as each move uses up part of a Drive Gauge just below the health bar, and a fighter can \"burn out,\" which slows their movement and makes certain offensive and defensive moves inaccessible for a period. The strategic implications of this system cannot be overstated, as these new tools do wonders for the overall fighting system. Drive Impacts in particular can swing the tide of battle in an instant, as catching an unsuspecting opponent with one will allow you to put a hurting on them. Keeping these tools in front of your mind is key to victory, and luckily it's not an overwhelming amount to recall. One of the major criticisms leveled at Street Fighter 5 was the rigidity of battles, with some going so far as to call it turn-based. However, these new mechanics make Street Fighter 6 feel more fluid. Despite these differences, all 18 characters somehow feel balanced. I imagine once the pros get their hands on the game, a few top fighters will emerge, but from the jump there was never a matchup I thought to be too difficult to overcome. Characters who have previously suffered in other areas have new abilities to make up for it--Zangief, for example, has a running throw with armor properties that can absorb projectiles, which are an old nemesis of his. The new fighters also fit right into the mold, perfectly complimenting the existing roster while also serving as a new puzzle for players to crack open. I've already seen some Manon players online that gave me nightmares, and can only imagine how much more potent these new faces will be in the hands of the Street Fighter faithful. No matter how simple Street Fighter 6 can seem, novice players are going to feel some trepidation when stepping into the ring for the first time. The game is ready for you, though, as Capcom has implemented a new Modern control scheme that makes controlling fighters more like Super Smash Bros. than traditional Street Fighter. This gives new players a foundation from which to learn, but that growth does have a ceiling. If you decide to transition to the Classic control scheme, players will need to learn the manual input controls that have been used since Street Fighter 2. While Modern controls did not translate well for me personally--I've been throwing quarter-circle Hadokens since I was six years old--I always appreciate the offer of a new stepping stone for novice players. The easiest place to learn SF6, in either Modern or Classic style, is in Fighting Ground, which is the \"traditional\" SF experience. This is where you'll find familiar modes like Arcade Mode, online ranked and casual matches, and offline versus modes. This section's shining feature, however, is its Practice area, which houses some of the best in-game tutorials the series has ever had. Practice Mode has the classic freeform Training mode fans expect, but it also holds full tutorials for the game's core system as well as character guides and combo trials for all 18 characters on the roster. These character guides are a deep dive into what makes each fighter tick, as it explains not only their special moves, but also the best situations in which to use them. While I am a Zangief main, I've spent time in these modes to be confident enough with Marisa to take her online, and it didn't take me long to get there. Street Fighter 6 is a robust, fighting game that is of a premiere quality ... Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned prosFighting Ground also lets you tinker with in-game commentators, one of the more ballyhooed features of Street Fighter 6. The game allows players to pick real-world commentators from the fighting game community, who \"call\" matches as if players are competing at Evo. While the novelty is fun at first--hearing Steve \"TastySteve\" Scott and WWE's Zelina Vega in an official Street Fighter game is super cool--the excitement those commentators generate during an actual tournament isn't ever captured here. Those experiences are fueled by genuine, off-the-cuff reactions to the action on the screen and in the arena, while those same voices sound like they're reading situations from a script here (which, of course, is exactly what they are doing). It's a problem similar to what WWE video games have dealt with in the past; trying to script reactions in such a way that they sound spontaneous is incredibly hard to do, and this admirable attempt misses the mark. If you're looking for a less traditional experience than what's offered in Fighting Ground, it's time to take a World Tour. This is a massive story mode with multiple chapters that unfolds across the entire world. The main hub is Metro City of Final Fight fame, and it is stuffed with things to do and references for longtime Capcom fighting game fans to find. The rest of the mode is broken up into smaller locations based on stages from the core game. Italy's Colosseo is where you find Marisa, and Jamaica's Bathers Beach is Dee Jay's hangout, for example. These are one-off locales you'll visit sparingly, so they're not as big as Metro City, but they all still have a charm to them. The story being told in World Tour does not live up to the standard set by fighting games like Tekken 7 and Mortal Kombat 11. However, this isn't much of a problem, as everything happening around the story makes up for it in a big way. World Tour is essentially a Street Fighter RPG, where the fighting mechanics serve as the battle system, and it is very silly fun. As I'm walking through the streets of Metro City, I can challenge virtually anyone I want to a fight, be they a food truck attendant, an old lady going to the store, or a young troublemaker getting up to no good. Some potential opponents will initiate the attack instead, and can sometimes come in a group, forcing players to defeat a series of opponents. With every victory, my avatar gains experience and levels up both their core stats and the fighting styles I'm using at the time. This \"challenge anyone\" mechanic is also technically impressive, as it really does let players challenge anyone. The game seamlessly goes from challenging a passerby, into a fight, and then returning to free roaming without loading. The \"stage\" is whatever we were standing in front of at that moment, and as I'm fighting, other NPCs that were standing around will flow into the background and cheer us on. There is a sacrifice being made here, however, and for some it might be a big one--there is a noticeable dip in frame rate when fighting in World Tour, one that immediately reverts to 60 FPS once you're out of a battle. And the visual quality of the stages and random fighters is nowhere near as good as Ryu fighting Ken on a carefully crafted stage. These performance issues are unfortunate, but I didn't focus on them much as I was too busy enjoying the silliness of fighting every Metro City denizen that passed by me, or using money to buy a hat that somehow improves my kicking power. The hero in World Tour is a fully customizable avatar you create, and you have control over everything from their hair to their body size. As previously mentioned, clothing can be purchased or earned as rewards throughout the mode, with each piece of clothing offering a stat boost in a certain area. Also, if you have a favorite costume set, but you know you have more powerful gear, you can set your appearance separately from what's equipped. This lets you look how you want while also getting all of the benefits of the new gear you pick up, which is a huge plus. While I want to be able to fight like a ninja, I don't always want to look like one, and World Tour offers that flexibility. Leveling up fighting styles is the other major customization option and growth path. Your avatar's moveset is in your hands, and as you progress through the story of World Tour, you meet the 18 \"masters\" of the world--aka the playable roster of Street Fighter characters. After earning their respect through mission completion or even a one-on-one fight, your avatar will be \"enrolled\" as a student and given access to that character's moveset. You'll pick a core moveset for normals, but then you can pick and choose which special moves you want your character to use. At one point, my avatar used Dee Jay's Rolling Sobat, Blanka's Rolling Attack, Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick, and Ken's Shoryuken, and I could change things up whenever I wanted. That versatility and ability to create your own fighter down to the moveset is something new for the franchise and a core part of what makes World Tour fun. Using a fight stick to control an avatar in this mode is rough. The camera controls do not translate to a controller with only one stick, so getting around the city is cumbersome. The game does offer a solution, though not an elegant one: I can activate my fight stick as \"Player 1\" and my normal controller as \"Player 2,\" and switch between the two at will depending on if I'm moving around Metro City or fighting a Mad Gear member. While this does mean extra space is needed for two controllers at once, I appreciate the convenience of the easy switch every time I want to use it. Your avatar also takes center stage in the Battle Hub, which is the final section of the Street Fighter 6 experience. This is basically a middle ground between World Tour and Fighting Ground, where players bring their avatars into a massive dome lined with arcade cabinets. You can sit down at a cabinet and wait for a challenger while training, or you can join a queue of players already seated, the digital equivalent of putting a quarter on the machine. This brings me to one of the major sticking points of any fighting game in the modern era: Netcode. Street Fighter 6's netcode sings, no matter who I'm fighting or, incredibly, which server I'm logged into. I made sure to log into the North America, South America, and Asia servers during my review time, and nearly every match I played in all three felt like my opponent was sitting in the room next to me. That's not to say it's perfect, as personal internet connections also are a major factor in performance, but the advent of rollback netcode has been a major boon to the entire fighting genre, and Street Fighter 6 is the latest beneficiary. I had a couple of matches in the North America region that did have some netcode issues, but my online play experience as a whole has been overwhelmingly positive. Gallery If you want some variety, you can venture over to the classic games section of the hub, which offers full arcade ports of games from the classic Capcom catalog. Street Fighter 2, Final Fight, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo were all available during the review period, and every one of them ran beautifully both when playing free play and shooting for the top of the leaderboard in High Score Challenge. Or, if you want something more novel, you can walk into the center of the arena and challenge anyone in there to a fight using your avatar, with each fighter based on their current World Tour builds. These fights can get wacky whether you're in them or spectating them, and they were always a welcome change of pace after multiple matches at the arcade machines. I expect Battle Hub to be a major hangout when the game launches, and while I cannot predict how the online experience will hold up when that happens, I can say that my time for this review was clean as a sheet. Fighting games in the modern age live on through their extra content, and Street Fighter 6 is no exception. Capcom has not only already confirmed the first four characters coming via downloadable content, but, much like Street Fighter 5, the game will feature its own economy complete with multiple currencies--Drive Tickets that are earned in-game, and Fighter Coins that can be earned in-game or purchased separately--as well as a battle pass which will offer avatar gear, emotes, and other perks in both a free and premium track. Given how strong the base game is, having more content and being able to play the game in different ways is an exciting prospect. I can't get enough of Street Fighter 6. It's been my last thought when I go to bed and my first thought when I wake up. It has a beautifully constructed fighting system, but also offers modes that take the game very seriously and, in other cases, not seriously at all. There are some small issues with performance in World Tour, but none of those are enough to derail the overall package. With the releases of new Tekken and Mortal Kombat games, it very much feels like we're in a new golden era for the fighting game genre.

What distinguishes SF6 from previous iterations are the core universal mechanics shared by all characters. While the effects and execution are the same for each fighter, these mechanics have their own distinct flair and flourish of personality depending on the character you choose. These universal mechanics are also where much of Street Fighter 6's gameplay depth is. The Drive system is SF6's new universal battle mechanic, and I'm amazed at how much it adds to a match despite being simple to grasp. By pressing the two medium attack buttons, I can parry an attack using Drive Parry, or, with Drive Rush, I can immediately dash forward out of it for a burst of speed that can catch opponents off guard or introduce new combo sequences.","content_length":899,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"Functionally, players that are experienced with Street Fighter 4's Focus Attack Dash Cancel or Guilty Gear's Roman Cancels will feel right at home. By pressing both heavy attacks, I can initiate a Drive Impact that can stagger an opponent and leave them open, ensuring that overly defensive players can be opened up. If an opponent is backed into a corner, landing this will make them bounce off the wall, adding a variety of other strategic considerations and opportunities. Drive Reversals, meanwhile, allow me to block an attack and counter with a move that, while not very damaging, will help escape tricky spots. Finally, Overdrive lets me power up special attacks like the EX systems of old. These aren't unlimited, however, as each move uses up part of a Drive Gauge just below the health bar, and a fighter can \"burn out,\" which slows their movement and makes certain offensive and defensive moves inaccessible for a period.","content_length":932,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"The strategic implications of this system cannot be overstated, as these new tools do wonders for the overall fighting system. Drive Impacts in particular can swing the tide of battle in an instant, as catching an unsuspecting opponent with one will allow you to put a hurting on them. Keeping these tools in front of your mind is key to victory, and luckily it's not an overwhelming amount to recall. One of the major criticisms leveled at Street Fighter 5 was the rigidity of battles, with some going so far as to call it turn-based. However, these new mechanics make Street Fighter 6 feel more fluid. Despite these differences, all 18 characters somehow feel balanced. I imagine once the pros get their hands on the game, a few top fighters will emerge, but from the jump there was never a matchup I thought to be too difficult to overcome.","content_length":843,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"Characters who have previously suffered in other areas have new abilities to make up for it--Zangief, for example, has a running throw with armor properties that can absorb projectiles, which are an old nemesis of his.

I've already seen some Manon players online that gave me nightmares, and can only imagine how much more potent these new faces will be in the hands of the Street Fighter faithful. No matter how simple Street Fighter 6 can seem, novice players are going to feel some trepidation when stepping into the ring for the first time.

These are one-off locales you'll visit sparingly, so they're not as big as Metro City, but they all still have a charm to them. The story being told in World Tour does not live up to the standard set by fighting games like Tekken 7 and Mortal Kombat 11.

With every victory, my avatar gains experience and levels up both their core stats and the fighting styles I'm using at the time. This \"challenge anyone\" mechanic is also technically impressive, as it really does let players challenge anyone. The game seamlessly goes from challenging a passerby, into a fight, and then returning to free roaming without loading.

These performance issues are unfortunate, but I didn't focus on them much as I was too busy enjoying the silliness of fighting every Metro City denizen that passed by me, or using money to buy a hat that somehow improves my kicking power.

Your avatar's moveset is in your hands, and as you progress through the story of World Tour, you meet the 18 \"masters\" of the world--aka the playable roster of Street Fighter characters.

That versatility and ability to create your own fighter down to the moveset is something new for the franchise and a core part of what makes World Tour fun. Using a fight stick to control an avatar in this mode is rough. The camera controls do not translate to a controller with only one stick, so getting around the city is cumbersome. The game does offer a solution, though not an elegant one: I can activate my fight stick as \"Player 1\" and my normal controller as \"Player 2,\" and switch between the two at will depending on if I'm moving around Metro City or fighting a Mad Gear member.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Street Fighter 6 Review - Battle Hardened","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/","post_date":"June 2, 2023 at 9:22AM PDT","content":"While this does mean extra space is needed for two controllers at once, I appreciate the convenience of the easy switch every time I want to use it.

You can sit down at a cabinet and wait for a challenger while training, or you can join a queue of players already seated, the digital equivalent of putting a quarter on the machine.

It's one which relies on a lack of combat, putting players in horrifying situations they can't win, and demanding they run and hide instead. Through countless imitators and even a few sequels, Frictional Games has had its formula repeated, but Amnesia: The Bunker is not the latest in that lineage. It plays quite differently, though it still feels like a classic Amnesia game in vital ways, and it's this combination of old and new that helps make it the studio's scariest game since The Dark Descent. Amnesia: The Bunker is, in some ways, the Amnesia you may know already. You'll play in first-person as a character who is suffering from memory loss and must piece together their own history, as well as that of the unnerving locale in which they inevitably find themselves. In The Bunker, that character is Henri Clement, a French soldier during World War I who loses consciousness while rescuing a fellow soldier from harm's way, then awakens in the titular bunker seemingly all alone--though he will soon wish that were truly the case. Out of the frying pan... Through scattered notes, the story of the labyrinthine bunker will come into focus. It's an entertaining, albeit detail-light, saga that seems to tie directly to other games in deep-cut ways that some players will appreciate. But it's just as easy to play it and not have any context for the story at all, or take it as a standalone horror story about a man trapped in a maze with a monster. It works well enough in each case, but it does feel like there's less narrative to unpack than past games in the series. Amnesia: The Bunker is much less predictable than past games in the series, and even includes variable elements that change across playthroughs. This gives it more replayability than past games from Frictional, and it works really well in that way. Important items such as a wrench for creating shortcuts, a lighter to light torches, and dog tags that reveal locker codes can be found in different spots with each new playthrough. Even locker codes change across playthroughs--sorry, guide writers--meaning each player who enters the bunker is truly on their own, making the game more challenging in an age where answers are usually found online for those lost and scared. The variable elements are an exciting new wrinkle, but they're also only an accompaniment to the game's centerpiece: its monster, which ceaselessly lurks throughout the bunker largely unscripted. This makes every encounter much scarier, as it tends to stay hidden unless you've messed up in some way. In this way, the monster is an enforcer to ensure you're operating at peak performance, and in the bunker that means several different things are happening: You'll want to keep the generator running, which provides lighting to the many corridors and wings you'll unlock and explore. You'll want to keep noise to a minimum, which means no sprinting through the halls, or at least hiding soon after doing so. It also means staying healthy, as you share the dark hallways with hungry rats who bite you and leave you bleeding, which the monster can trace back to you as it hunts. I absolutely love these systems because they interact so well together. With limited inventory space, the game adds almost a management-sim element to it, where you'll sometimes need to make runs outside the safe room just to amass a few more canisters of gasoline, even if you happen to know where the next important quest item is, such as a key or a particular note. Whenever the fuel runs out, the lights go off, allowing the monster to roam freely, but with the lights on, the monster mostly only comes out when you've made too much noise. You could, in theory, beat the game entirely in the dark with nothing but your hand-cranked flashlight, but good luck to those trying. It is a ruthless, tireless, insatiable beast. You can add new inventory slots by finding bags around the bunker, but even at max capacity, you won't have enough room to carry everything you need, which demands sacrifices. Do I take the watch that tells me how much time is left until the fuel is exhausted, or do I take the healing items in case the rats prove hard to evade? Do I throw an empty bottle to create a diversion, or do I bring it to the fuel room to fill up for the generator back in the safe room? There's no moment in a playthrough in which you won't be weighing options such as these, making every moment a thoughtful exercise in survival. All resources are finite, so using any of them must come with good reason or else you're damning yourself to failure. Solutions have multiple right answers, too, which rewards or punishes smart or thoughtless decisions, respectively. For example, a locked door can be broken open with a thrown brick, shot with a gun, or opened with a key--if you happen to find it. Yes, Amnesia has a gun now, and if you're worried about it removing the game's best parts, don't be. The gun cannot kill the monster, and ammo is extremely limited. At best, it can stun the monster for a moment, giving you a chance to escape around a corner or drag a barrel in front of a door to impede its pursuit. You can merely slow the creature, and doing so only angers it.... and into the fire. Gallery I was also surprised to see how well the setting works. In previews, I was worried that the plain hallways would grow stale quickly, but not only does the game diversify its setting in interesting ways, but even those original images of standard military bunker corridors end up feeling interesting because of how shortcuts, hiding spots, and tools are tucked away in each of them. With a centralized supply room full of locked lockers, it's good to spend time seeking out combinations that unlock them, but as always, these considerations burn fuel and likely make noise, so it's always a risk. Every room feels very intentionally built and there's no wasted space in the game. All of these variable elements combine to put more control in Amnesia players' hands than they've ever had before, and that tension--where you may live or die not because of a tough scripted moment, but because you created a problem for yourself--makes The Bunker the team's scariest game since 2010. Despite an impressive year of horror games so far, I believe Amnesia: The Bunker is the scariest game of 2023. It works incredibly well in its quiet moments, like when I'd hide under a bed or in a closet, hoping the monster doesn't spot me, as well as during chase sequences which had my heart in my throat every single time. That feeling of being chased is so unnerving, especially in first-person through a pitch-black hallway as inhuman snarls close in on you. So often, I'd just barely make it back to the safe room with enough time to slam the door and lock it behind me. It's intense, and each time I survived, I felt my body loosen up as my heart rate would slowly return to normal. I've recently worried I've been desensitized to horror games since I've been playing them for 25 years. Amnesia: The Bunker helped me find those evasive thrills again. It's terrifying, and I love it. The element that ties this all together is the game's incredible audio design. In such a lonesome and haunted space, Amnesia: The Bunker is the signature play-it-with-headphones experience. Each footstep echoes in such a way that feels betraying. Sometimes the monster may breathe on the other side of a wall as you inch past a group of rats, hoping they don't bite you. Even cranking the flashlight reverberates through the turn-of-the-century walls, which can be enough to give yourself away if the creature is close by. It's all so atmospheric that even if you aren't consuming its somewhat light story details, you'll be pulled into its world all the same. Despite those numerous thrills, it's worth noting that they aren't all entirely novel. The way in which the monster roams the ceiling and walls around you, emerging unscripted from crawlspaces with the pounce of a lion when you screw up, is comparable to Alien: Isolation. This will make the game, as different from past Amnesia games as it is, a bit familiar to horror aficionados. Still, I feel as though the variable elements built on top of that mechanic, as well as the dizzyingly haunting setting, do elevate The Bunker's monster to something scarier than that particular xenomorph. With reasons to return to the game after hitting the credits, Amnesia: The Bunker is the longest-lasting game in the series so far. And thanks to incredible atmosphere, opportunities for player creativity, and an inventory metagame that makes each success or failure entirely your own, Amnesia: The Bunker is proof that Frictional has still got it. This is a team that continues to refine the horror genre, and though I've found each of their games intriguing in different ways, they haven't scared me the way this one does in a long time.","length":9028,"tokens":1929,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Amnesia: The Bunker Review - Shellshocked","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/","post_date":"June 5, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"2010's Amnesia: The Dark Descent altered the horror genre forever as the breakout game made in a particular hide-and-seek style. It's one which relies on a lack of combat, putting players in horrifying situations they can't win, and demanding they run and hide instead. Through countless imitators and even a few sequels, Frictional Games has had its formula repeated, but Amnesia: The Bunker is not the latest in that lineage. It plays quite differently, though it still feels like a classic Amnesia game in vital ways, and it's this combination of old and new that helps make it the studio's scariest game since The Dark Descent. Amnesia: The Bunker is, in some ways, the Amnesia you may know already.

Out of the frying pan.. Through scattered notes, the story of the labyrinthine bunker will come into focus. It's an entertaining, albeit detail-light, saga that seems to tie directly to other games in deep-cut ways that some players will appreciate. But it's just as easy to play it and not have any context for the story at all, or take it as a standalone horror story about a man trapped in a maze with a monster. It works well enough in each case, but it does feel like there's less narrative to unpack than past games in the series.

Important items such as a wrench for creating shortcuts, a lighter to light torches, and dog tags that reveal locker codes can be found in different spots with each new playthrough. Even locker codes change across playthroughs--sorry, guide writers--meaning each player who enters the bunker is truly on their own, making the game more challenging in an age where answers are usually found online for those lost and scared. The variable elements are an exciting new wrinkle, but they're also only an accompaniment to the game's centerpiece: its monster, which ceaselessly lurks throughout the bunker largely unscripted.

You'll want to keep noise to a minimum, which means no sprinting through the halls, or at least hiding soon after doing so. It also means staying healthy, as you share the dark hallways with hungry rats who bite you and leave you bleeding, which the monster can trace back to you as it hunts. I absolutely love these systems because they interact so well together. With limited inventory space, the game adds almost a management-sim element to it, where you'll sometimes need to make runs outside the safe room just to amass a few more canisters of gasoline, even if you happen to know where the next important quest item is, such as a key or a particular note.","content_length":944,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Amnesia: The Bunker Review - Shellshocked","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/","post_date":"June 5, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"Whenever the fuel runs out, the lights go off, allowing the monster to roam freely, but with the lights on, the monster mostly only comes out when you've made too much noise. You could, in theory, beat the game entirely in the dark with nothing but your hand-cranked flashlight, but good luck to those trying. It is a ruthless, tireless, insatiable beast.

There's no moment in a playthrough in which you won't be weighing options such as these, making every moment a thoughtful exercise in survival. All resources are finite, so using any of them must come with good reason or else you're damning yourself to failure. Solutions have multiple right answers, too, which rewards or punishes smart or thoughtless decisions, respectively. For example, a locked door can be broken open with a thrown brick, shot with a gun, or opened with a key--if you happen to find it.

At best, it can stun the monster for a moment, giving you a chance to escape around a corner or drag a barrel in front of a door to impede its pursuit. You can merely slow the creature, and doing so only angers it... and into the fire. Gallery I was also surprised to see how well the setting works. In previews, I was worried that the plain hallways would grow stale quickly, but not only does the game diversify its setting in interesting ways, but even those original images of standard military bunker corridors end up feeling interesting because of how shortcuts, hiding spots, and tools are tucked away in each of them. With a centralized supply room full of locked lockers, it's good to spend time seeking out combinations that unlock them, but as always, these considerations burn fuel and likely make noise, so it's always a risk.","content_length":903,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Amnesia: The Bunker Review - Shellshocked","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/","post_date":"June 5, 2023 at 6:00AM PDT","content":"Every room feels very intentionally built and there's no wasted space in the game.

Its release was polarizing for a number of reasons, but its evolving formula of action role-playing endured, enjoying a resurgence with its post-launch expansion that carried through years of ongoing seasonal updates. It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that each of those years helped inform the design of Diablo IV, a game which confidently delivers gameplay that has been carried forward and refined from both Diablo II and III, while also establishing a strong foundation for the franchise's future. Diablo games have always contained stories for their single-player campaigns, but you'd be forgiven for thinking of past storylines as merely contextualization for the game's primary focus: dungeon-crawling. That's where Diablo IV makes one of its most striking changes: It not only takes its story far more seriously, but it tells one that's far more engrossing than ever before. As a traveling wanderer, you come across a small town of villagers on a snow-capped mountain range looking for some aid. After killing some creatures and returning, you're welcomed as a hero and given food and shelter, only for the villagers to try to use you in a ritual sacrifice to Lilith, co-creator of Sanctuary and recently resurrected antagonist of this tale, moments later.

There's a big, bad demon, and you're the only one who can stop it. But Diablo IV makes intelligent use of Lilith, layering her motivations slowly to the point where you can't help but consider her side of the argument. She's not driven solely by the lust for destruction. Instead, she's grieving, with the place she once created to escape the endless cycle of war between heaven and hell now being used as a staging ground to continue it. She's an antagonist that has been slighted by those she trusted at every turn, and while her means of exacting justice provide the reason for your entire crusade in the first place, it's surprising and equally welcome when Diablo IV forces you to slow down and consider the true goal of your struggle. The trope of the sole savior has been tried and tested in Diablo for years, and Diablo IV doesn't completely change that. Instead, it puts a much larger emphasis on companions than ever before, with most acts centered around a new party member rather than a demon you're eventually hunting down. An early standout is Vigo, a prideful knight who is forced to endure a conscience-ruining loss after a single, selfish decision. It's not just Vigo's remorse that is heart-wrenchingly conveyed, but also the horrors of his eventual redemption, leading to one of the more powerful character moments in the entire game. Vigo's story is a teaser for many similar arcs that follow, all of which do a great job of providing a cause for a character to join your fight while also contextualizing their motivations to continue (or abstain) from the enduring conflict. This applies to most of the allies you'll recruit in your fight against Lilith, each of which has their own motivations that feel faithful to their respective journeys. It's a level of care I can't recall being given to many past Diablo companions, and Diablo IV certainly makes far more liberal use of them through the campaign to make them feel purposeful. Bringing together this ragtag group takes place over Diablo IV's extensive six acts, some of which you can tackle in different orders. Previous Diablo titles had each act accompanied by a change in locale, but in Diablo IV it only takes a few moments before you're given free rein to explore its intimidatingly large, interconnected map. Here you can transition from frigid mountaintops to desolate deserts in just a matter of minutes, with the transitional areas doing a good job of masking an otherwise jarring change. Having a static layout that you can learn and get comfortable with imbues exploration with a greater sense of wonder than previous hubs, which were often filled with enemies to kill before diving into the next dungeon. The geography also gives towns and larger cities a sense of place on a bigger map. Each distinct area is shown off with a great amount of visual detail, with Diablo IV incorporating a delightfully macabre style that is befitting of its violent story. It's not trying to overly correct some of the criticisms laid on Diablo III either, with pops of color used tastefully to highlight areas of hope and kinship that contrast against the broader strokes of dread and fear paintingthe rest of the landscape. Things don't always hold up when the camera zooms into to give conversations a cinematic feel, as a degradation in detail on character models and environments is more discenrable. Regardless, it's still a striking presentation that looks incredible in motion, while also keeping information clear enough to read when fights get chaotic. The moment-to-moment action in Diablo IV is one of its strongest traits, which is for the best given how genre-defining the series has been over the years. There's an argument to be made that Diablo III went too far in the direction of simplification, and that's exactly where the Diablo IV course-corrects in smart ways. You're still limited to a total of six active abilities at a time--four on your hotbar and two on each mouse button for those on PC--but how you construct your build is no longer linear. Instead, each new level lets you invest a point in a branching skill tree, with each of its core nodes branching out further into new abilities and associated passive perks. You need to invest a certain number of total points to continue unlocking each of these nodes, so you will have to think carefully about abilities and how they serve your greater build. It's a system that allows for a lot of flexibility, letting you experiment with focusing on one specific ability as the foundation of your build or dabbling with ways to combine two entirely different paths, such as empowering your summoned skeletons while also firing off loads of blood-infused magic as a Necromancer. Diablo IV confidently delivers gameplay that has been carried forward and refined from both Diablo II and III, while also establishing a strong foundation for the franchise's futureExperimentation is further encouraged by Diablo IV's low cost to respec, and unlimited chances to do so. Unlike the more punishing approach in Diablo II, you can completely redefine your build at any time for a small fee of in-game gold, approaching your skill tree with a different idea in mind or just making some small changes to adjust for a difficult fight. This freedom is empowering in a similar way to that of Diablo III's fluid build system, but still requires you to engage meaningfully with synergies to make your builds viable. It feels like the culmination of all the ways previous games in the series have allowed you to play while catering to as many playstyles as possible, but without many of the critical compromises from the last time out. The cost for a respec does naturally increase the higher your level, but it never got to a point where I felt it was too expensive in relation to the amount of gold I was earning at the time. Thanks to this system, I felt free to continually change up my approach to my Necromancer. I started with a combination of skeleton summoning, shadow damaging attacks, and some blood spells for survivability. The Necromancer's unique ability lets me either summon minions from corpses or sacrifice the ability entirely for passive advantages, which lead me to realize that I could theoretically play a Necromancer entirely as a pseudo-mage with blood and bone abilities. After some taxing boss battles, I decided to go all in on a summoning build that accentuated the abilities of my skeleton soldiers, mages, and large, hulking golem, each of which had three different variations I could combine to find perfect synergy. It was consistently satisfying to find a build that worked for a couple of hours and then completely change it, either through necessity or curiosity. Seeing small decisions manifest as big changes in terms of overall viability gives me faith that each class is going to be picked apart for various approaches that maximize elements of different playstyles. While the skill tree is where you will ultimately establish the basis of your build, Aspects of Power are a new facet of the role-playing formula that allows you to hone it. These collectible skills (so to speak) can be combined with rare pieces of gear to turn them into custom legendary items, imbued with the exact ability that complements the build you're constructing. This alleviates some of the headaches associated with grinding out dungeons in the hopes of a particular legendary piece of gear dropping, while also providing a new avenue of options for build construction. That isn't to say that it diminishes the rush of a big legendary drop though. Legendary weapons can often feature the same abilities that Aspects do, but will regularly have better percentage rolls on their effectiveness, still making them the ideal path to the most optimal late-game builds. Aspects of Power are obtained by clearing the many dungeons sprawled around the map, each of which feature their own multi-stage objectives to complete. Some are as simple as killing enemies and depositing their souls to progress further, while others require you to hunt down a specific foe in search of a key that lets you reach lower levels of the dungeon. Each of these concludes with a boss fight, which for the most part are less interesting than those found in main story dungeons. Bosses throughout the story are multi-layered bouts, with shifting enemy attacks that can completely change the landscape you're fighting in, forcing you to consistently think about positioning and when the best moments for attack are. Bosses in these more common dungeons lack that sense of complexity, and I often found my skeleton warriors completely overwhelming many of them to the point where many of the bosses would just stand in place and attack until dead. Given the sheer number of dungeons on offer, it might not have been possible to retain the same level of tension across every boss encounter, but when you're bouncing between several of these as you grab Aspects of Power throughout your campaign, it's difficult not to notice the stark contrast in quality between the two. As with any Diablo title, Diablo IV is nowhere near complete once you've rolled credits on the campaign. World Tiers return to incentivize you to go through everything again with a higher degree of difficulty but also more rewards to reap. It's welcome that Diablo IV retains the option that allows you to jump into a more challenging World Tier from the start this time, preventing a potentially frustrating first playthrough devoid of any meaningful challenge. Outside of increasing the World Tier, the map becomes littered with additional side activities that join regular side quests, rotating open-world dynamic quests (similar to patrols in Destiny 2), and Strongholds. These are extremely hostile areas that are densely populated with enemies usually a level or two higher than you, providing a larger challenge to overcome than regular groups of foes around the open-world. Minor objectives also make this feel like smaller-scale, open-air dungeons, with new waypoints and merchants usually unlocked once you've rid the area of the threat. Larger scale world boss fights that are best tackled with numerous other players you will find in the open world are also available, although no multiplayer features were available during the review period. Whispers of the Dead encapsulate timed bounties that popup throughout the world, with each one rewarding you with an additional currency that can be turned in for caches of gems, weapons, and more. Nightmare Sigils, which can be obtained through completing Whispers of the Dead quest, can be used to unlock additional Nightmare Dungeons. These add new modifiers to existing dungeons around the map that can do anything from changing the types of enemies you encounter to rolling new random abilities they might have at their disposal, with the allure of even rarer loot drops enticing you to run them over and over again. There is a familiar but equally expansive framework in place already in Diablo IV that should satiate you across multiple playthroughs, with plans already detailed by Blizzard to expand on this through seasons of new content similar to that of Diablo III. Diablo IV, at this time, cannot escape comparison to the past of the franchise it belongs to, but it's thankfully a game that has been crafted with a strong awareness of what made each one either revered or reviled. It represents a measured approach to combining the many elements from previous entries that worked into a system that feels like the new standard-bearer for action role-playing. Coupled with a new benchmark for storytelling in the franchise, and a solid narrative foundation for any potential new adventures, it's easy to see Diablo IV as something I'll regularly check-in on for a long time to come.","length":15322,"tokens":3163,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"With Diablo 4's release now here, it's sometimes difficult to reconcile that Diablo III is over a decade old.

But Diablo IV makes intelligent use of Lilith, layering her motivations slowly to the point where you can't help but consider her side of the argument. She's not driven solely by the lust for destruction. Instead, she's grieving, with the place she once created to escape the endless cycle of war between heaven and hell now being used as a staging ground to continue it. She's an antagonist that has been slighted by those she trusted at every turn, and while her means of exacting justice provide the reason for your entire crusade in the first place, it's surprising and equally welcome when Diablo IV forces you to slow down and consider the true goal of your struggle. The trope of the sole savior has been tried and tested in Diablo for years, and Diablo IV doesn't completely change that.","content_length":862,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"Instead, it puts a much larger emphasis on companions than ever before, with most acts centered around a new party member rather than a demon you're eventually hunting down. An early standout is Vigo, a prideful knight who is forced to endure a conscience-ruining loss after a single, selfish decision. It's not just Vigo's remorse that is heart-wrenchingly conveyed, but also the horrors of his eventual redemption, leading to one of the more powerful character moments in the entire game. Vigo's story is a teaser for many similar arcs that follow, all of which do a great job of providing a cause for a character to join your fight while also contextualizing their motivations to continue (or abstain) from the enduring conflict. This applies to most of the allies you'll recruit in your fight against Lilith, each of which has their own motivations that feel faithful to their respective journeys.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"It's a level of care I can't recall being given to many past Diablo companions, and Diablo IV certainly makes far more liberal use of them through the campaign to make them feel purposeful. Bringing together this ragtag group takes place over Diablo IV's extensive six acts, some of which you can tackle in different orders. Previous Diablo titles had each act accompanied by a change in locale, but in Diablo IV it only takes a few moments before you're given free rein to explore its intimidatingly large, interconnected map. Here you can transition from frigid mountaintops to desolate deserts in just a matter of minutes, with the transitional areas doing a good job of masking an otherwise jarring change. Having a static layout that you can learn and get comfortable with imbues exploration with a greater sense of wonder than previous hubs, which were often filled with enemies to kill before diving into the next dungeon.

It's not trying to overly correct some of the criticisms laid on Diablo III either, with pops of color used tastefully to highlight areas of hope and kinship that contrast against the broader strokes of dread and fear paintingthe rest of the landscape. Things don't always hold up when the camera zooms into to give conversations a cinematic feel, as a degradation in detail on character models and environments is more discenrable. Regardless, it's still a striking presentation that looks incredible in motion, while also keeping information clear enough to read when fights get chaotic.

You're still limited to a total of six active abilities at a time--four on your hotbar and two on each mouse button for those on PC--but how you construct your build is no longer linear. Instead, each new level lets you invest a point in a branching skill tree, with each of its core nodes branching out further into new abilities and associated passive perks. You need to invest a certain number of total points to continue unlocking each of these nodes, so you will have to think carefully about abilities and how they serve your greater build.","content_length":712,"content_tokens":146,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"It's a system that allows for a lot of flexibility, letting you experiment with focusing on one specific ability as the foundation of your build or dabbling with ways to combine two entirely different paths, such as empowering your summoned skeletons while also firing off loads of blood-infused magic as a Necromancer. Diablo IV confidently delivers gameplay that has been carried forward and refined from both Diablo II and III, while also establishing a strong foundation for the franchise's futureExperimentation is further encouraged by Diablo IV's low cost to respec, and unlimited chances to do so. Unlike the more punishing approach in Diablo II, you can completely redefine your build at any time for a small fee of in-game gold, approaching your skill tree with a different idea in mind or just making some small changes to adjust for a difficult fight.","content_length":863,"content_tokens":166,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"This freedom is empowering in a similar way to that of Diablo III's fluid build system, but still requires you to engage meaningfully with synergies to make your builds viable. It feels like the culmination of all the ways previous games in the series have allowed you to play while catering to as many playstyles as possible, but without many of the critical compromises from the last time out. The cost for a respec does naturally increase the higher your level, but it never got to a point where I felt it was too expensive in relation to the amount of gold I was earning at the time. Thanks to this system, I felt free to continually change up my approach to my Necromancer.

After some taxing boss battles, I decided to go all in on a summoning build that accentuated the abilities of my skeleton soldiers, mages, and large, hulking golem, each of which had three different variations I could combine to find perfect synergy. It was consistently satisfying to find a build that worked for a couple of hours and then completely change it, either through necessity or curiosity. Seeing small decisions manifest as big changes in terms of overall viability gives me faith that each class is going to be picked apart for various approaches that maximize elements of different playstyles. While the skill tree is where you will ultimately establish the basis of your build, Aspects of Power are a new facet of the role-playing formula that allows you to hone it.","content_length":1044,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"These collectible skills (so to speak) can be combined with rare pieces of gear to turn them into custom legendary items, imbued with the exact ability that complements the build you're constructing. This alleviates some of the headaches associated with grinding out dungeons in the hopes of a particular legendary piece of gear dropping, while also providing a new avenue of options for build construction. That isn't to say that it diminishes the rush of a big legendary drop though. Legendary weapons can often feature the same abilities that Aspects do, but will regularly have better percentage rolls on their effectiveness, still making them the ideal path to the most optimal late-game builds. Aspects of Power are obtained by clearing the many dungeons sprawled around the map, each of which feature their own multi-stage objectives to complete.","content_length":853,"content_tokens":163,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"Some are as simple as killing enemies and depositing their souls to progress further, while others require you to hunt down a specific foe in search of a key that lets you reach lower levels of the dungeon. Each of these concludes with a boss fight, which for the most part are less interesting than those found in main story dungeons. Bosses throughout the story are multi-layered bouts, with shifting enemy attacks that can completely change the landscape you're fighting in, forcing you to consistently think about positioning and when the best moments for attack are. Bosses in these more common dungeons lack that sense of complexity, and I often found my skeleton warriors completely overwhelming many of them to the point where many of the bosses would just stand in place and attack until dead.","content_length":802,"content_tokens":152,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"Given the sheer number of dungeons on offer, it might not have been possible to retain the same level of tension across every boss encounter, but when you're bouncing between several of these as you grab Aspects of Power throughout your campaign, it's difficult not to notice the stark contrast in quality between the two. As with any Diablo title, Diablo IV is nowhere near complete once you've rolled credits on the campaign. World Tiers return to incentivize you to go through everything again with a higher degree of difficulty but also more rewards to reap. It's welcome that Diablo IV retains the option that allows you to jump into a more challenging World Tier from the start this time, preventing a potentially frustrating first playthrough devoid of any meaningful challenge. Outside of increasing the World Tier, the map becomes littered with additional side activities that join regular side quests, rotating open-world dynamic quests (similar to patrols in Destiny 2), and Strongholds.","content_length":998,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/","post_date":"May 30, 2023 at 9:39AM PDT","content":"These are extremely hostile areas that are densely populated with enemies usually a level or two higher than you, providing a larger challenge to overcome than regular groups of foes around the open-world.

Larger scale world boss fights that are best tackled with numerous other players you will find in the open world are also available, although no multiplayer features were available during the review period. Whispers of the Dead encapsulate timed bounties that popup throughout the world, with each one rewarding you with an additional currency that can be turned in for caches of gems, weapons, and more.

There is a familiar but equally expansive framework in place already in Diablo IV that should satiate you across multiple playthroughs, with plans already detailed by Blizzard to expand on this through seasons of new content similar to that of Diablo III. Diablo IV, at this time, cannot escape comparison to the past of the franchise it belongs to, but it's thankfully a game that has been crafted with a strong awareness of what made each one either revered or reviled. It represents a measured approach to combining the many elements from previous entries that worked into a system that feels like the new standard-bearer for action role-playing. Coupled with a new benchmark for storytelling in the franchise, and a solid narrative foundation for any potential new adventures, it's easy to see Diablo IV as something I'll regularly check-in on for a long time to come.","content_length":1155,"content_tokens":225,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Humanity Review - What Is A Man?","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/humanity-review-what-is-a-man/1900-6418071/","date":"May 24, 2023 at 4:30PM PDT","content":"Some days you wake up, put on your clothes, and head to work or school. Some days you sleep in and enjoy a hard-earned day off. And some days your consciousness emerges from slumber in the form of a tiny ethereal Shiba Inu, and mysterious glowing orbs instruct you to guide a seemingly unending stream of human souls through winding geometric constructs to a radiant square of light. You know, normal things. This is the premise of Humanity, a new spatial puzzle game from developer Tha and publisher Enhance Games. Players familiar with the Enhance Games library of titles like Rez and Tetris Effect likely have some idea of what to expect: an artsy experience with chill vibes, minimalistic yet striking visuals, intuitive gameplay, experimental music, and an undercurrent of positivity and warmth. Humanity ticks all of those boxes off easily, while also establishing itself as a unique and charming puzzle game that both calls back to old favorites and adds interesting new innovations. As the nameless meme-dog, you are tasked with guiding the stream of humans that emerges from a mysterious portal \"into the light\"--a specially marked square on the field. To accomplish this, you place directional commands on spaces where the flow of humans are walking. If they need to turn left to avoid careening into a pit, you bark and leave a marker to tell them to turn left. Simple! It's a little bit of Lemmings, but perhaps more akin to Dreamcast sleeper classic Chu Chu Rocket. But then things get more complicated. Stages (known in-game as \"trials\") are broken up into sets of \"Sequences,\" built around new abilities and gameplay elements. The levels become tall, towering structures where height and depth are prominent factors. Gimmicks appear, such as fans, conveyor belts, and switches that require a flow of human traffic to activate, forcing you to learn how to effectively herd the masses. Suddenly, you have the power to make the humans jump over obstacles, to float in the air, or break into separate groups. You learn the things humans can do inherently without your guidance: Climbing. Swimming. Grouping together to push heavy but movable objects. A rival faction, known only as the \"Others,\" appears. Weapons appear. And yet, throughout it all, you struggle, you persevere, and you guide humanity to the light for an unknown yet seemingly noble purpose. Many stages contain a giant, golden human avatar called Goldy, who represents the wishes, dreams, and desires of the populace. Goldy must be touched by and assimilated into the flow of humanity as well, and guided to the exit. Yes, you can usually finish the trial without all of the Goldys, but not always. And you will need a certain number of Goldys not just to get a bunch of neat new options and cosmetic unlocks, but to open the final trial of each sequence. For what is humanity without its dreams and desires? Just an endless, mindless march. It all starts simply enough, though. The way Humanity gradually builds, easing you into new mechanics and gameplay concepts, is immensely satisfying: Your reward for overcoming a difficult trial is something new and exciting to experiment with and challenge. Controls are simple and intuitive, and the basic visuals make it easy to understand what's going on at a glance--a blessing when thousands of humans are flooding out into the level. Humanity is an easy game for anyone to pick up and play, and that's great. The visual and control simplicity does cause some problems at times, however. In particular, the platforming elements can be a little bit fiddly. It's especially hard sometimes to tell at what depth and position your dog-avatar is at, leading to many instances where you find yourself careening off a cliff. (You can't actually die, but it can still be an annoyance at times when you need to move and react quickly.) Surmising what platforms you can and can't scale without a bit of help can be a bit tricky, too. If you're lucky enough to be playing the game in stereoscopic 3D with VR, however, I'm sure this is much less of an issue. Physics also plays a part in several of Humanity's puzzles: Jumping, floating, pushing, and group movement are among the mechanics you're taught from a very early stage in the game. They can feel awkward to work with at first, but I eventually got a grasp on how they functioned through a lot of trial and error. Sometimes, however, unpredictable things happen. Large crowds can sometimes push a few stragglers out of the boundaries you've set,causing a host of unexpected problems as they hit hazards, move objects, and trigger switches you didn't intend them to. This tends to happen more often when using the fast-forward feature--which you'll use a lot. It's frustrating to have to restart a stage because a few stray humans were pushed out of their \"herd\" and caused problems. As part of Humanity's accessibility features, every puzzle includes an optional video showing a correct solution (though not always how to obtain the Goldys). As someone who does not consider themselves particularly good at spatial puzzles, I am not ashamed to admit making use of this feature at times when I felt completely, hopelessly stumped. But it's an inelegant and somewhat overbearing way of helping folks. A hint system would have been a welcome addition; I often felt like sometimes, all I needed was a little nudge in the right direction rather than having the whole solution spelled out for me.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4143064-1. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4143064-1. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4143064-1. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4143064-1. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">You can just look up what you need in the video, but navigating playback using only the PlayStation controller is… not great. Some sort of rewind feature would also be nice for those times when you mistakenly lay down the wrong command or screw up a directional input and mess up minutes' worth of setup. The need for multiple trial-and-error restarts can be aggravating. Taken as a whole, however, Humanity is a charming, engaging, and inviting puzzle adventure of a breed that seems all too rare nowadays. Its constantly-evolving gameplay, unique premise, and striking audiovisual landscape make for a game that's easy to get sucked into for long periods of time. Even better, when you finish the main game, you can dive into the various user-created levels folks all over the globe are already crafting--or try your own hand at creation. Creation is something humanity excels at, after all.","length":6790,"tokens":1499,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Humanity Review - What Is A Man?","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/humanity-review-what-is-a-man/1900-6418071/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 4:30PM PDT","content":"Some days you wake up, put on your clothes, and head to work or school.

If you're lucky enough to be playing the game in stereoscopic 3D with VR, however, I'm sure this is much less of an issue. Physics also plays a part in several of Humanity's puzzles: Jumping, floating, pushing, and group movement are among the mechanics you're taught from a very early stage in the game. They can feel awkward to work with at first, but I eventually got a grasp on how they functioned through a lot of trial and error.

It's frustrating to have to restart a stage because a few stray humans were pushed out of their \"herd\" and caused problems.

Taking place not long before the events laid out in The Fellowship of the Ring, the crux of the story is instantly recognizable to anyone even peripherally familiar with the series: Gollum must find Bilbo and take back his \"precious\" at any cost, while avoiding the wrath of Sauron along the way. You control Gollum in third person (except when swimming, weirdly). Being barely capable of lifting a metal spoon, let alone wielding a weapon, combat is not the focus, save for occasional opportunities to sneak up from behind for a strangle-kill, which he's somehow able to muster the energy for. Instead, the game revolves around all things stealth. You utilize relatively sparse climbable surfaces to creep around from above, crawl through the shadows to stay out of sight on ground level, and throw stones to knock out light fixtures or distract guards. Before going any further, we need to address the elephant (or Mûmakil, if you will) in the room: In the state it was in at time of review, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was not ready to be played. In my roughly 11 hours of playtime on \"Performance\" mode on a PlayStation 5, the game crashed over 120 times (yes, I counted; masochist, remember?), averaging about one crash every five minutes. After my 20th-or-so crash, I got the dreaded \"save data corrupted\" message, only to realize I'd lost half a day's progress upon reloading. In multiple other instances, game-breaking bugs--such as a companion I was charged with protecting instantly dying over and over again for no discernible reason--forced me to restart entire levels, losing significant progress. Finally, during an especially tedious and time-consuming puzzle, the crashes became too frequent to possibly make it to the next checkpoint in time. Determined though I was to get through to the end and make these setbacks feel worthwhile, I threw in the towel at 40% completion, defeated. After suffering through and starting a new game, overwriting the data from my original playthrough, I tried turning off a setting I had previously overlooked: \"Gollum Hair Simulation.\" Doing so significantly decreased the number of crashes, though it did not seem to have much of an effect on other major bugs throughout. All that this setting seems to do is make Gollum's hair look a little bit greasier and more fluid, which--if you ask me--doesn't exactly sound worth the near-constant rebooting. As such, I highly recommend making sure that this setting is turned off, if you decide to put yourself through this game. Beyond these potentially game-ruining issues, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is packed to the brim with all other sorts of bugs, ranging from hilarious to white-knuckle-frustrating. Sometimes, I loaded into checkpoints only to find myself stuck in the ground, before promptly dying in a disgusting gurgle. Other times, I got stuck in \"crouch,\" or became unable to move entirely, forcing me to restart the game. Cutscenes frequently end abruptly, cutting off the regularly out-of-focus NPCs mid-sentence. A harrowing escape scene will be set to dramatic music in one run, and then entirely silent the next. The list goes on. Beyond its overly simple level design, jarringly dated graphics, and deeply uninteresting gameplay, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is broken to the point where it's nearly unplayableEven in the rare instances when the game is humming along without a hitch, the graphics in The Lord of the Rings: Gollum are remarkably unrefined for a 2023 release. The environmental art design can be compelling from a distance, particularly in the hellish underground fortress of Barad-dûr, where you spend most of the first half of the game as a prisoner-slave. But up close, the vines, rock faces, and pits of fire that make up the world around you are mostly flat, lacking in detail, and sometimes just straight up blurry. Bubbles underwater only come into frame when you stand still, and appear as motionless, hand-drawn circles. Some of the cave art inspected in Gollum's den early in the game looks like it could have literally been drawn in Microsoft Paint. The NPCs look more on par with characters you'd expect to see in 2011's The Lord of the Rings: War in the North than a current-gen game. And while Gollum himself is comparatively impressive in terms of art and animation, his cartoonishly cross-eyed style won't be for everyone, and even he often appears out of focus. Again, the list goes on. Daedalic has said some of these issues will be addressed with a day one patch. What will be fixed remains to be seen, but in its pre-patched state, this game is simply too far from finished to suggesting anyone play it, let alone considering its $60 price tag. Now, technical achievement isn't the sole determining factor when it comes to fun. There are plenty of examples of games that were riddled with issues upon release, but, carried by the strength of their gameplay, still managed to be an overall enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is not an example of such a game. Its most glaring gameplay issue is its mission design. Sans a few slightly more in-depth objectives at big story moments, the majority of your tasks amount to some version of, \"Follow the person!\" \"Collect the thing!\" or, in one case, literally \"Stand in line!\" It would be one thing if these missions took place in a large, open-world environment, but instead, the majority of them in the first half of the game are set in the cramped confines of Barad-dûr, where you're forced to repeatedly revisit many of the same locations in order to progress the story. The game is entirely linear, so the path to the next checkpoint always feels on rails, leaving no real room for exploration or outside-the-box thinking. The cookie-cutter nature of the missions is not offset by a particularly fun or inventive traversal system, either. Getting from point A to point B almost always involves utilizing the same small set of tools--namely, climbing a predefined path on a wall, shimmying along ledges, and jumping from monkey bars. It feels like they cherry-picked a few of the most basic climbing mechanics from the games that popularized them, but failed to contextualize them with the variety or freedom necessary to make the experience rewarding. When it comes to stealth, the gameplay is no less basic, mostly thanks to the befuddling incompetence of the enemy AI. Crawling through the shadows is enough to keep you hidden from the Orc guards. They may even notice you making your way across a room and go to investigate, but if you enter a shadow in time, you'll be fully invisible to them, even when they are no more than a few inches away. Occasionally you'll need to remove a light source to make it through, which the Orcs respond to by walking over, staring at it for a moment, and then returning to their path without turning it back on. Though the gameplay is, more often than not, too easy, you are significantly hindered by Gollum's stats. Your stamina, which is required for running and climbing certain objects, depletes quickly and reloads at a snail's pace. Your health is similarly fragile; you take fall damage from sometimes hilariously low heights, and resources to replenish HP (worms and mushrooms, mostly) are few and far between. There are no new abilities or upgrades to unlock in the game. While it is a potentially interesting idea to reflect Gollum's withered nature in the character's lowly base stats, it ends up playing out more like an annoyance than a meaningful storytelling device. The story is, however, the best thing that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has going for it, and it's backed by an appropriately epic soundtrack. Moments of dialogue between Gollum and his alter-ego Sméagol, where you must convince the other personality to go along with a decision, serve as interesting glimpses into the internal moral struggle of the character that made him so archetypal in the first place (even if the voice acting guiding these scenes pales in comparison to Andy Serkis’ iconic portrayal in the films). A handful of new characters add some context and texture to what is one of the least explored periods of time in Tolkien's series. Even so, they could have gone much deeper, and the game surrounding the story is ultimately too much of a distraction for it to feel truly resonant. Daedalic might have been better off investing more resources into enriching the story and approaching the game as one of its hallmark point-and-click adventures, instead of shooting for the stars. As it stands, there may be enough here for lore-hungry diehard fans of the series to sink their teeth into, but for the average player, the story can't shoulder the weight of the rest of the game. Much like Gollum's quest for the One Ring, my quest to complete The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was full of endless setbacks, impossible odds, and ever-increasing levels of madness. And, like Gollum, my journey was doomed from the start. So if the developers' main goal was to really put you in the shoes of such a pitiful, unloveable character faced with constant pain and suffering at every turn, they were at least successful at that.","length":12300,"tokens":2824,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum Review - We Don't Wants It, We Don't Needs It","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-review-we-dont-wants-it-we-dont-needs-it/1900-6418070/","post_date":"May 25, 2023 at 1:00AM PDT","content":"When it comes to art, I'm something of a masochist.

Unfortunately, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is not an example of such a game. Its most glaring gameplay issue is its mission design. Sans a few slightly more in-depth objectives at big story moments, the majority of your tasks amount to some version of, \"Follow the person!\" \"Collect the thing!\" or, in one case, literally \"Stand in line!\" It would be one thing if these missions took place in a large, open-world environment, but instead, the majority of them in the first half of the game are set in the cramped confines of Barad-dûr, where you're forced to repeatedly revisit many of the same locations in order to progress the story.","content_length":821,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum Review - We Don't Wants It, We Don't Needs It","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-review-we-dont-wants-it-we-dont-needs-it/1900-6418070/","post_date":"May 25, 2023 at 1:00AM PDT","content":"The game is entirely linear, so the path to the next checkpoint always feels on rails, leaving no real room for exploration or outside-the-box thinking. The cookie-cutter nature of the missions is not offset by a particularly fun or inventive traversal system, either. Getting from point A to point B almost always involves utilizing the same small set of tools--namely, climbing a predefined path on a wall, shimmying along ledges, and jumping from monkey bars. It feels like they cherry-picked a few of the most basic climbing mechanics from the games that popularized them, but failed to contextualize them with the variety or freedom necessary to make the experience rewarding. When it comes to stealth, the gameplay is no less basic, mostly thanks to the befuddling incompetence of the enemy AI. Crawling through the shadows is enough to keep you hidden from the Orc guards.","content_length":879,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum Review - We Don't Wants It, We Don't Needs It","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-review-we-dont-wants-it-we-dont-needs-it/1900-6418070/","post_date":"May 25, 2023 at 1:00AM PDT","content":"They may even notice you making your way across a room and go to investigate, but if you enter a shadow in time, you'll be fully invisible to them, even when they are no more than a few inches away. Occasionally you'll need to remove a light source to make it through, which the Orcs respond to by walking over, staring at it for a moment, and then returning to their path without turning it back on. Though the gameplay is, more often than not, too easy, you are significantly hindered by Gollum's stats. Your stamina, which is required for running and climbing certain objects, depletes quickly and reloads at a snail's pace. Your health is similarly fragile; you take fall damage from sometimes hilariously low heights, and resources to replenish HP (worms and mushrooms, mostly) are few and far between.

The story is, however, the best thing that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has going for it, and it's backed by an appropriately epic soundtrack. Moments of dialogue between Gollum and his alter-ego Sméagol, where you must convince the other personality to go along with a decision, serve as interesting glimpses into the internal moral struggle of the character that made him so archetypal in the first place (even if the voice acting guiding these scenes pales in comparison to Andy Serkis’ iconic portrayal in the films) A handful of new characters add some context and texture to what is one of the least explored periods of time in Tolkien's series.","content_length":853,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum Review - We Don't Wants It, We Don't Needs It","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-review-we-dont-wants-it-we-dont-needs-it/1900-6418070/","post_date":"May 25, 2023 at 1:00AM PDT","content":"Even so, they could have gone much deeper, and the game surrounding the story is ultimately too much of a distraction for it to feel truly resonant. Daedalic might have been better off investing more resources into enriching the story and approaching the game as one of its hallmark point-and-click adventures, instead of shooting for the stars. As it stands, there may be enough here for lore-hungry diehard fans of the series to sink their teeth into, but for the average player, the story can't shoulder the weight of the rest of the game. Much like Gollum's quest for the One Ring, my quest to complete The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was full of endless setbacks, impossible odds, and ever-increasing levels of madness. And, like Gollum, my journey was doomed from the start. So if the developers' main goal was to really put you in the shoes of such a pitiful, unloveable character faced with constant pain and suffering at every turn, they were at least successful at that.","content_length":977,"content_tokens":217,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"Lego thrives on versatility and variety.

In Lego 2K Drive, your vehicle auto-switches from roadster to off-road vehicle to boat based on whatever you need at a given time. The click-clack of your vehicle instantly reconstituting itself into something new when you hop from a road to a river just feels great every time. A generous nitro boost and a dedicated jump button mean you can hop over obstacles and scale hills with ease. Other cars or small buildings in the way? No problem, just smash right through them and they'll explode into a thousand Lego bricks, building your boost meter in the process. This effectively makes the whole world your playground, letting you carve paths through it. There's almost never a hard barrier between you and the fun. Naturally, the races are more tightly controlled. To keep them competitive, there are checkpoints and hard walls. But the races add another layer that isn't present in the open world, in the form of power-ups. This is a staple of kart racers, and the ones present here are, for the most part, fun and diverse ways to mess with your opponents. You can instantly tell the rocket icon will let you fire a homing missile on your next opponent, for example, or that the ghost icon makes you invulnerable to obstacles for a short time. Power-ups with less universally recognizable icons, like a rolling mine, become clear enough after the first time you use them. The one major miss among the power-ups is the spider web, which falls into the kart racer weapon category of obstructing your opponent's view and slowing them down. That effect would be fine by itself, but it also forces you to jam on a button to clear the web, which just feels too distracting and unfair in the middle of a race. On top of that, the button is mapped to the same one as jump, so after clearing the web you're almost guaranteed to accidentally jump when you didn't mean to. (A late-game race against a spider-themed rival was especially frustrating for this reason). The campaign's three biomes are bursting with things to do in addition to traditional kart races. There are also On-The-Go events that trigger automatically when you drive through a gate, minigames like Rescue (help townspeople from rampaging skeletons, clowns, etc) or Defend (protect a set of towers), World Challenges to set time records, and Quests where you help a townsperson with some odd job. Two of the three biomes--Big Butte County and Prospecto Valley--can feel similar due to their sheer cliffs and rural landscapes, but the third is a radical departure both thematically and visually. And sometimes your activities can have permanent effects on the world, like mowing down weeds to replace them with speed-boosting crystals or unlocking jump-jets that will populate throughout the biomes. With a wide variety of vehicles that have their own stats, Lego 2K Drive also smartly lets you set a handful of loadouts that can be swapped anytime you're not actively in an event. One of your loadouts may be more focused on maxing out your acceleration while another could focus on hairpin turns. I had one loadout set aside for when I wanted to mow down weeds without having to manually swap my off-road vehicle to a lawnmower. As you progress through the campaign, you'll also unlock the ability to equip an increasing number and more powerful perks, which can have a huge impact on your racing style and strategy. The presentation is perfectly kid-friendly, but the racing hooks are deep enough to draw in arcade racing fans of any age. While most of the campaign is a smooth ride, I did hit a pacing issue once when nearing the end, when I needed to grind some levels to qualify for the next phase in the story. I found that most of the minigames and Quests awarded very little XP, so my best bet was to replay races I had already completed on harder or even easier difficulties. It was a small roadbump, but notable regardless since it added an hour or so of extra playtime to what is already an 8-10-hour core campaign. The length would have been perfectly satisfying without the extra padding. The final race in the Sky Cup Grand Prix is an especially thrilling high point, pun intended, and even after finishing the campaign, the open world still feels inviting and fresh with tons of challenges I haven't even touched yet. While not exactly affiliated with The Lego Movie, Lego 2K Drive obviously took tonal cues from that hit animated movie. The setting is mostly city-based sets, and the writing carries that same sense of tongue-in-cheek all-ages humor that occasionally breaks the fourth wall. The interplay between the two race announcers (Vikki Wheeler and Parker Carr) is a highlight, with hilarious commentary before major races. Your ultimate goal is to gather enough flags to qualify for the Sky Cup Grand Prix, the ultimate racing competition held in a floating race course in the clouds, which is currently dominated by an obnoxious cheater named Shadow Z. A veteran racer named Clutch Racington sees potential in you and becomes your clueless comic mentor, ushering you through the steps of your journey to become the ultimate driver and unseat Shadow Z. With all that emphasis on plucking your racer from obscurity to become the new champion, you might expect there to be heavy character customization, but sadly no. You can pick from a handful of premade models, but you can't craft your own Lego minifig character from scratch, or even mix-and-match the parts from the models you have available. More models unlock throughout the campaign and there are more available in the shop, however. That's an odd oversight given how remarkably robust Lego 2K Drive is with its vehicle-crafting features. The building interface is incredibly flexible and evocative of an actual Lego building set, with the same snap-on satisfaction of putting each individual brick into place. The menus are so full-featured that it can be a little overwhelming at first, but it doesn't take long to get a feel for all your options and start tinkering away. And once you start, it's hard to stop. There's almost no limit to what you can do with the tools. You could start a build from scratch, modify an existing model with new parts, or even just give your favorite car a custom paint job. Ultimately the building options are cosmetic, and no amount of flaps will make your car airborne. How it actually handles comes down to stats, which is its own sub-menu. While the pre-built vehicles you obtain in the campaign will have their own values assigned to stats like top speed and health, in build mode you can select from several stat packages that balance their values with names like \"Healthy Option\" (high health) or \"Edging Out\" (good top speed and maneuverability at the expense of health). You can purchase higher-tier stat packages with your earned cash, but they're all relatively inexpensive and the presets keep any of them from feeling unbalanced. It's also nicely flexible in that there doesn't seem to be a limit on which stats you can attach to vehicles. Vehicles are given weight classes based on their number of pieces, but I had no problem attaching the same stat package to both a Light and Very Heavy vehicle. For a more meditative experience, the build shop also includes an Instructions mode, made to imitate the feeling of actually building a Lego set from a bag full of parts. It breaks down one of the pre-built models, giving you individual steps with several parts to assemble, and then you simply grab them one at a time to rotate and then click them into place. I've always enjoyed the relaxed, therapeutic experience of putting together a Lego set, and this captures that feeling almost precisely. Expanding your collection of cars to have more to build and modify is where Lego 2K Drive appears to aim to have longevity. A season pass called the Drive Pass promises more racers and vehicles, but it isn't active at the time of this review. Aside from a wide array of vehicles, you also earn money through the campaign. But having completed it, I have barely enough to buy a few cars, so it seems clear that the goal is to keep players coming back long-term. I'm satisfied with my current collection and I'll see what the Drive Pass has to offer, but completionists will definitely need to commit to earn a full collection of cars and racers. You can also buy a premium currency and then turn it into the in-game currency, which can certainly be a concern for a kid-friendly game with slow in-game progression. But since any competitive advantage comes from the inexpensive stat packages themselves, there doesn't seem to be a competitive advantage for the DLC vehicles. Whatever the future holds, Lego 2K Drive is already a complete package--a raucous arcade racer that marries elements of open-world racing and kart racing and wraps it all in a bright, playful Lego package. It has enough real racing bona fides to satisfy adults, but the most pleasant surprise is how its combination of humor, explosive action, and robust building tools will make you feel like a kid again.","length":12261,"tokens":2700,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"Lego thrives on versatility and variety.

With all that emphasis on plucking your racer from obscurity to become the new champion, you might expect there to be heavy character customization, but sadly no.","content_length":887,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"You can pick from a handful of premade models, but you can't craft your own Lego minifig character from scratch, or even mix-and-match the parts from the models you have available. More models unlock throughout the campaign and there are more available in the shop, however. That's an odd oversight given how remarkably robust Lego 2K Drive is with its vehicle-crafting features. The building interface is incredibly flexible and evocative of an actual Lego building set, with the same snap-on satisfaction of putting each individual brick into place. The menus are so full-featured that it can be a little overwhelming at first, but it doesn't take long to get a feel for all your options and start tinkering away. And once you start, it's hard to stop. There's almost no limit to what you can do with the tools.","content_length":813,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"You could start a build from scratch, modify an existing model with new parts, or even just give your favorite car a custom paint job. Ultimately the building options are cosmetic, and no amount of flaps will make your car airborne. How it actually handles comes down to stats, which is its own sub-menu. While the pre-built vehicles you obtain in the campaign will have their own values assigned to stats like top speed and health, in build mode you can select from several stat packages that balance their values with names like \"Healthy Option\" (high health) or \"Edging Out\" (good top speed and maneuverability at the expense of health) You can purchase higher-tier stat packages with your earned cash, but they're all relatively inexpensive and the presets keep any of them from feeling unbalanced. It's also nicely flexible in that there doesn't seem to be a limit on which stats you can attach to vehicles.","content_length":912,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"Vehicles are given weight classes based on their number of pieces, but I had no problem attaching the same stat package to both a Light and Very Heavy vehicle. For a more meditative experience, the build shop also includes an Instructions mode, made to imitate the feeling of actually building a Lego set from a bag full of parts. It breaks down one of the pre-built models, giving you individual steps with several parts to assemble, and then you simply grab them one at a time to rotate and then click them into place. I've always enjoyed the relaxed, therapeutic experience of putting together a Lego set, and this captures that feeling almost precisely. Expanding your collection of cars to have more to build and modify is where Lego 2K Drive appears to aim to have longevity. A season pass called the Drive Pass promises more racers and vehicles, but it isn't active at the time of this review. Aside from a wide array of vehicles, you also earn money through the campaign.","content_length":979,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/","post_date":"May 24, 2023 at 9:42AM PDT","content":"But having completed it, I have barely enough to buy a few cars, so it seems clear that the goal is to keep players coming back long-term. I'm satisfied with my current collection and I'll see what the Drive Pass has to offer, but completionists will definitely need to commit to earn a full collection of cars and racers. You can also buy a premium currency and then turn it into the in-game currency, which can certainly be a concern for a kid-friendly game with slow in-game progression. But since any competitive advantage comes from the inexpensive stat packages themselves, there doesn't seem to be a competitive advantage for the DLC vehicles. Whatever the future holds, Lego 2K Drive is already a complete package--a raucous arcade racer that marries elements of open-world racing and kart racing and wraps it all in a bright, playful Lego package. It has enough real racing bona fides to satisfy adults, but the most pleasant surprise is how its combination of humor, explosive action, and robust building tools will make you feel like a kid again.","content_length":1056,"content_tokens":220,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"After Us Review - Abstract Dystopia","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/after-us-review-abstract-dystopia/1900-6418068/","date":"May 23, 2023 at 11:05AM PDT","content":"Nothing quite compels you to buy into a game's stakes like happening upon the decaying carcass of a dog who's starved to death. This is the first of several emotional moments in After Us. The surrealistic set dressing of this 3D platformer is regularly morbid but it makes for quite a compelling dystopian world to explore, if only to satiate an innate curiosity--how did the Earth end up like this and is there anyone left? The simple combat and good-but-not-great platforming mechanics bog down the experience a bit but After Us' incredible environmental storytelling of a doomed world clinging to a feeble hope more than makes up for it. In After Us, you play as Gaia, a young spirit tasked with tracking down and salvaging the souls of the last creatures on Earth. These include animals like the aforementioned canine, the last dog who died of hunger, and coming across others lead to plenty of somber moments of human cruelty--the last eagle caged and plucked, for instance, and the final whale to be harpooned. There's a present-day storyline that runs parallel that isn't all that interesting as it's difficult to relate to the mostly-silent Gaia, who displays small signs of emotion during certain cutscenes but seems to largely view the world around her with passivity. The history of this Earth's past, which you uncover in your pursuit of the lost animal souls and optional collectibles, is far more captivating and works as a strong narrative backbone for the platformer. Running and jumping are Gaia's primary ways of navigating the world, and these actions are complemented by other platforming staples like hovering, rail-grinding, wall-running, and dashing. She's a bit too floaty and loose to control in certain platforming segments--there were quite a few moments where a frustrating mistiming meant I accidentally leaped over a floating chunk of freeway and plunged to my death or sprinted a step too far and skidded off the top of a skyscraper. Most often, failure was the result of the controls working against me, not my own mistakes. Thankfully, the checkpoint system in After Us is relatively forgiving so even the most irritating of deaths are only small setbacks. The platforming mechanics excel in more momentum-driven instances, like running up the sides of dilapidated steel structures to reach the top of a signal tower that's slowly falling apart or leaping between power lines as lightning crackles around you and briefing illuminates the next jump you need to make. The momentum of Gaia's movements makes things tricky when the game asks you to take things slow and focus on precision, but the exciting sense of speed she can achieve makes for some fun highlights during the game's more action-focused moments. After Us occasionally dips its toes into combat and puzzles too, the latter of which I enjoyed more than the former. Combat is quite simple and not very engaging. As Gaia races through the world, she'll run into the final remnants of mankind, the oil-coated Devourers. They lumber after Gaia, lunging at her with easily dodgeable grapples. If they do happen to nab her, escaping the grab is a simple quick-time event. They don't pose much of a threat to the nimble Gaia, who can put them to rest with ease by blasting them with a ball of pure life energy. Combat does get a bit trickier when shielded enemies show up--in a fun twist, they use television screens to block out your weapon, life, to protect their oil-dependent lives. In these fights, you have to time Gaia's attacks instead of just blasting indiscriminately. But these enemies soon become easy to overcome as well, especially with regular use of Gaia's quick-to-charge, area-of-effect stun. Battles against Devourers are just too simple and samey to be enjoyable. The puzzles, on the other hand, are a delight. For the most part, they aren't overly complicated, avoiding the trap of falling into tedium. Pretty much every puzzle is built around the platforming but what you're being tasked to do changes to reflect the various environments, creating a nice diversity of challenges. One moment, you have to figure out how to reach junction boxes to power on a TV, then flip between channels until you find the one that will teleport you to the next platform you have to reach. The next, you're slowly ascending through a series of bird cages that open and close whenever Gaia uses her area-of-effect stun on them, forcing you to carefully time the momentum of your running and jumping with the speed of your attacks. After Us regularly builds on its puzzles within the same level too, sometimes several times, creating complexity and challenge by requiring increasingly difficult execution. I may know that I need to plug in the television and change it to the airplane channel to progress--it's a variation of a problem I'd already solved earlier--but now I have to figure out how to reach three junction boxes to power the TV on, not just one. It's the same problem, so I understand what I need to do at the jump, but now it's just a bit harder. This style of puzzle progression allows After Us to maintain the forward momentum of its story. You're rarely wracking your brain over where you need to go or what exactly you need to do for very long. And even if you do run into a roadblock with a puzzle, After Us is rather open-ended following its very linear opening. Soon into the game, the path forward branches, giving you a choice over where you want to go next. A fast travel system makes it easy to return to these branches whenever you want, meaning you can take a break from the path you're on at any given moment if it's giving you trouble and return to it later. This also eases the pressure for completionists as you can go back to grab collectibles you missed--which are graciously marked on your map regardless if you actually saw them when you passed them by--at any point. The star of the show, however, is the visuals. The abstract nature of the spaces that Gaia explores depicts the impact of humanity on nature in this horrific yet oddly beautiful way. Polluted skies crackle with fierce lightning, illuminating crumbling buildings and pools of sentient oil that greedily reach for Gaia with hungry tendrils as she passes, desperate to consume the last remnants of meager light in an increasingly dark world. A dark room is littered with angelic feathers, dozens of empty cages strung up above hinting at the desperate last days of the birds that once filled the skies--skies that now cloud your vision with viscous smoke. Most eerie of all are the lifeless statues that populate every level of the game, as if all of humanity was simultaneously petrified at the dawn of the end of the world.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4142178-blades. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4142178-blades. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4142178-blades. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4142178-blades. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Optional collectibles slowly reveal how the world came to be this way but it isn't hard to discern if you pay attention.

After Us' visual storytelling doesn't wholly condemn humanity, however, using brief snippets of love and hope among the rubble of civilization to add a dash of tragedy to the decimation. There's a bewitching sadness to the whole thing, with the abstract world feeling reminiscent of experiences like Little Nightmares and Inside. You can find statues of running children, frozen mere inches away from their parents' outstretched arms, just short of being reunited as the world came to a close. You can find the petrified remains of people gathering together in an illuminated square of brilliant light and just holding one another, choosing hope even as the world burned down around them. For as much as After Us initially decries humanity and labels them as Devourers, the agents of consumption and greed, the game ultimately posits that they are victims of their own hubris, with too many who confused the pursuit of progress for happiness. The surreal world design of After Us' dystopian world carries the game, encouraging you to keep going even when the momentum-driven platforming and creative puzzles give way to tedious combat. Gaia isn't all that compelling a protagonist, but the stories she uncovers--whether they're of the Earth's final animals or the Devourers who killed them--make up for it, inviting you to delve deeper into the dark of After Us' dying world and uncover exactly how it all fell apart.","length":8869,"tokens":1910,"chunks":[{"post_title":"After Us Review - Abstract Dystopia","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/after-us-review-abstract-dystopia/1900-6418068/","post_date":"May 23, 2023 at 11:05AM PDT","content":"Nothing quite compels you to buy into a game's stakes like happening upon the decaying carcass of a dog who's starved to death.

The Space Marine's Bolter (as it's commonly known) is not the machine gun equivalent it's often portrayed as in other games. This powerful firearm is essentially a rapid-fire rocket launcher, capable of penetrating almost any armor and then blowing up the Imperium's enemies from the inside out. Developer Auroch Digital clearly understood the assignment with Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, as the eponymous weapon is tremendously fun to use as you rip and tear your way through eight hours of '90s-inspired first-person shooting. The Bolter roars with an emphatic racket, and each pull of the trigger packs an almighty punch, ferociously propelling these explosive rounds through flesh and bone until the battlefield is little more than a crimson pile of viscera and sinewy chunks. Classic retro shooters like Unreal Tournament and Quake are obvious inspirations behind Boltgun's fast-paced and frenetic combat, but it's the original Doom that feels like the principal source of reverence. The use of 2D sprites alongside 3D environments, color-coded keycard hunting, and garish, over-the-top violence all harken back to id Software's seminal title. Boltgun is unashamedly a Doom clone with a Warhammer skin, but Auroch has sprinkled in some modern touches, too, from the dizzying amount of particle effects on screen at any one time, to the intricate level of detail found on each and every weapon, to the sheer scale of some of its environments. Verticality is also heavily emphasized, with a jump and mantle animation giving you the chance to scramble and leap off ledges, much like in 2016's Doom reboot. All of this leads to Boltgun managing to capture a tangible sense of nostalgia while also tapping into the fluidity and pacing of a contemporary shooter. It's a familiar but potent mix, resulting in a viscerally satisfying game that's relatively easy to pick up and play. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

As battle-hardened Space Marine Malum Caedo, you're dispatched to the Adeptus Mechanicus Forge World of Graia to investigate some concerning goings-on. As it turns out, the Ad Mech were running experiments that have predictably gone awry and spawned a Chaos invasion. After a botched landing leaves you as the lone survivor, you're put to work cleansing the forces of Chaos armed with an ever-expanding supply of powerful weaponry. Boltgun's assortment of 41st-millennium armaments is at the heart of everything great about its fast-paced and sanguinary action. There's no denying that the titular Bolter is the star of the show, but every other weapon proves its worth, making this one of the more appealing arsenals in the genre. If you're not a Warhammer fan, having no prior knowledge isn't a barrier to entry in any way, but those who are will appreciate the attention to detail as each weapon looks and functions as it should. The Plasma Gun, for instance, is extremely deadly but volatile. It might deal massive damage, but it's also prone to overheating, at which point it can malfunction and hurt you, too. The Meltagun, on the other hand, unleashes an energetic beam of heat that can dissolve armor in a heartbeat, proving especially useful against tenacious enemies like the imposing Chaos Terminators. Even the Chainsword, which is always available as a melee option, can cut through the toughest foes given enough time. Boltgun [manages] to capture a tangible sense of nostalgia while also tapping into the fluidity and pacing of a contemporary shooter. It's a familiar but potent mix, resulting in a viscerally satisfying game that's relatively easy to pick up and playPart of what makes each of these murderous tools so fun to use is the tremendous audio and visual feedback across the board. Guns feel hefty and consume the soundscape with a cacophony of whirring thermal energy, thunderous bedlam, and the clink of spent casings crashing against the ground. Basic enemies go down in one or two shots and almost everything explodes on death, leaving behind buckets of blood and heretical failure. Ammunition for the more powerful weapons in your arsenal is relatively scarce, however, which ensures that the Boltgun remains a constant companion throughout your journey. The Bolter was my go-to when dealing with cannon-fodder enemy types such as human Cultists and swarms of plague-spewing Nurglings, but it's capable of taking down Chaos Space Marines in a pinch. Hidden secrets scattered throughout each level also provide temporary upgrades that can boost its damage output, such as the devastatingly explosive Kraken ammo. Despite this, I never felt like I had to \"save\" certain weapons to the point where I wouldn't end up using them. Ammo may not be especially plentiful, but there's enough to encourage you to bust out the big guns when dealing with Boltgun's most resilient opponents. It just makes sure never to undermine the Bolter, which in turn strengthens the viability of your entire arsenal. Juggling your firearms is vitally important when it comes to dealing with the variety of enemies you'll encounter as you trek across Graia. Even the weakest can pose a threat if they attack in numbers, so strafing, judicious use of the sprint button, and perpetual motion are the keys to survival. Boltgun's levels are fairly linear for the most part, but many of its environments are quite expansive. In between all of the compact corridor shooting, you'll also uncover these vast combat arenas where you're tasked with purging every enemy before moving on. Space Marines are basically walking tanks, yet you're still surprisingly nimble, able to fluidly traverse the battlefield while maintaining a palpable sense of weight as your colossal footsteps reverberate around the room and shake the screen. It's here where you're assaulted on all sides by all manner of Cultists and Chaos Daemons, from Plague Toads, which leap around the battlefield spitting green acid at you, to the Pink Horrors that split into Blue Horrors upon death. Boltgun is often at its best in these moments, where the exhilaration of barely surviving by the skin of your teeth accentuates its thrilling action. Gallery Unfortunately, these combat arenas also shine a spotlight on an issue id Software solved back in 2016's Doom. In true boomer shooter fashion, the health bar in Boltgun doesn't replenish over time. Instead, each level is filled with both health and armor pick-ups for you to grab when the need arises. This is par for the course, but being forced to run around, searching for healing items and ammo can take you out of the action for prolonged periods of time. Doom's Glory Kills and Chainsaw rectified this issue, and I can understand why Auroch Digital opted not to replicate a feature wholesale, but the old-school alternative is inherently archaic and detracts from the experience. Some of the levels are also quite samey, making it easy to get turned around because so many corridors look almost identical. The fact that there's no map only intensifies this issue. Despite these faults, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is an extremely fun game with a contagious reverence for classic '90s shooters and the Warhammer universe at large. Its entire arsenal of flesh-combusting weapons is a joy to use, and its simple gameplay loop is kept fresh by a steady supply of new armaments and enemy types to squash under the almighty boot of the Imperium. It's not trying to revolutionize the genre and that's perfectly fine; it's the type of game to hire avid Warhammer fan Rahul Kohli (Gears of War 5, Midnight Mass) to voice its protagonist, only to make him exceptionally easy to miss unless you stumble upon the \"Taunt\" button. There aren't any gameplay advantages to hitting this button, but you do get to hear Kohli relish in delivering some Space Marine-appropriate lines as he nails the angry, regal tone. That's almost worth the price of admission alone.","length":10098,"tokens":2256,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun Review - Purge And Tear","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/","post_date":"May 23, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"The Boltgun is perhaps Warhammer 40,000's most iconic weapon, yet it took until now for a video game to really nail its pulverizing impact. The Space Marine's Bolter (as it's commonly known) is not the machine gun equivalent it's often portrayed as in other games. This powerful firearm is essentially a rapid-fire rocket launcher, capable of penetrating almost any armor and then blowing up the Imperium's enemies from the inside out. Developer Auroch Digital clearly understood the assignment with Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, as the eponymous weapon is tremendously fun to use as you rip and tear your way through eight hours of '90s-inspired first-person shooting. The Bolter roars with an emphatic racket, and each pull of the trigger packs an almighty punch, ferociously propelling these explosive rounds through flesh and bone until the battlefield is little more than a crimson pile of viscera and sinewy chunks.","content_length":918,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun Review - Purge And Tear","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/","post_date":"May 23, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Classic retro shooters like Unreal Tournament and Quake are obvious inspirations behind Boltgun's fast-paced and frenetic combat, but it's the original Doom that feels like the principal source of reverence. The use of 2D sprites alongside 3D environments, color-coded keycard hunting, and garish, over-the-top violence all harken back to id Software's seminal title. Boltgun is unashamedly a Doom clone with a Warhammer skin, but Auroch has sprinkled in some modern touches, too, from the dizzying amount of particle effects on screen at any one time, to the intricate level of detail found on each and every weapon, to the sheer scale of some of its environments. Verticality is also heavily emphasized, with a jump and mantle animation giving you the chance to scramble and leap off ledges, much like in 2016's Doom reboot. All of this leads to Boltgun managing to capture a tangible sense of nostalgia while also tapping into the fluidity and pacing of a contemporary shooter.

It can go too far in its efforts to be deeply mysterious, especially in its first half, but engaging puzzles and unsettling art direction pull you along, even when mediocre combat and platforming mechanics get in the way of the fun. There's an interesting story in The Last Case of Benedict Fox, one wrapped up in an interesting world of supernatural intrigue that I want to know more about. It just takes a while to fully uncover its best parts. In The Last Case of Benedict Fox, you play as the titular detective, who breaks into a strange manor in order to investigate a ritual he wants to perform. The answers he seeks, unfortunately, reside in the minds of a young couple who are now dead. Thankfully, Benedict is connected to an eldritch-like demon who grants him supernatural powers, including the ability to go into the minds of those freshly dead. Going into Limbo--as Benedict calls it--transports you into a space of sprawling mind palaces, each filled with the deceased's worst nightmares, insecurities, and traumas transformed into physical monsters. As you explore further and farther, you find the necessary memories to unlock new parts of the manor in the real world and piece together the steps to the ritual. If all of that sounds a little convoluted and leaves you with many questions, that seems to be what The Last Case of Benedict Fox is going for, simply dropping you into a densely layered situation without the necessary build-up to fully grasp what's going on. The game holds its cards too close to the chest, unfortunately--going so far as to hide for the entire first half of the game what exactly the ritual that Benedict is researching even does and why he's looking for it. The plot swings way too far past intriguing and mysterious into confusing territory for the first half of its runtime. This makes for a deeply unwelcoming opening, which sets up a story and character motivations that are difficult to parse, with names, dates, lore, and jargon quickly thrown at you with little in the way of explanation. Once you manage to get a ways into the game, The Last Case of Benedict Fox graciously begins answering a few of the questions it poses, giving you more of a reason for wanting to explore its riveting Lovecraftian-inspired world, but it still just takes way too long to get there. Which is a shame because, as it turns out, The Last Case of Benedict Fox happens to be built upon a fascinating world and deep lore that's begging to be uncovered, a winning recipe for a metroidvania game given the genre's traditional focus on exploration. Once you're incentivized to go out and map the hallways of people's dying psyches there are a lot of cool supernatural threads to pull on, all styled in a world that feels somehow disturbingly colorful for how heavy its narrative gets. Each part of Limbo is more horrifyingly beautiful than the last. I especially enjoyed how the minds of the people you're jumping into inform each level's unique layout and environmental puzzles. One moment may find you running through a maze composed within the logic of a scientist, for example, the rhythmic clockwork of his dying mind transforming the space with a regular rhythm. And then the next, you're diving into the mind of a woman who died at the end of her emotional rope, with pools of poison, ichor-lined walls, and a frigid underbelly all that remains of her emotionally damaged core. Exploring these spaces is key to solving The Last Case of Benedict Fox's many environmental puzzles, which is the primary means of progression in the game. Early on, you discover that Benedict needs to find three pages, each detailing a step in the ritual needed to separate him from his companion. The pages are scattered about the manor, requiring a bit of sleuthing on your part, since whoever designed Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City Police Station clearly was also the architect of this manor--it is filled with an assortment of locks, each hiding secrets that allow you to further explore the manor or uncover more of the story. The keys you need lie in the memories of those who once lived in the manor, meaning you're regularly diving into the dying minds of those who once lived there to uncover their secrets. Is there a paper with notes on it that you need, but it's burned beyond recognition in the real world? Go into the mind of the person who saw it last, and explore the part of his brain that represents his suppressed guilt and anger of that moment. Does a locked door require three oddly specific keys to open? Better dive into the mind of the dead body nearby to see if he has a recollection of that key that you can bring back with you into the real world. A wider variety of puzzles exist within the Limbo worlds, too. I've found doors that required me to play a chess match in a certain way to get through them, and combination locks where I had to take a picture of the clues with my phone in order to refer back to them while inputting the answer. The Last Case of Benedict Fox is no pushover when it comes to flexing your brain, but it never quite reaches a degree of difficulty so off-putting that the brain twisters ever get irritating. In true metroidvania fashion, there are also locks tied to abilities. These come in two forms. There are some obstacles in the world--numeric locks and walls of miasma--that can only be surpassed by unlocking upgrades to Benedict's equipment, requiring you to find specific items in Limbo. Additionally, there are locks in Limbo--like breakable floors and demon-coated doorways--that only your demon companion can overcome, requiring you to get tattoos made from the inky blood carved out from enemies. With these parallel paths, you're regularly rewarded, whether it's for finding new areas and discovering equipment upgrades or overcoming enemies and collecting enough ink for a new tattoo. That said, for as enjoyable as it is to explore Limbo and uncover the secrets hidden away in people's minds, combat falls short. The Last Case of Benedict Fox is routinely dragged down by clunky and unrewarding combat mechanics. Benedict is designed as a careful fighter--his repertoire in combat consists of a simple counter, slow melee strikes, a flintlock-like flare gun, and a meanderingly slow healing mechanic. These mechanics don't match the pace of the enemies that Benedict is going up against, as most foes are quite nimble and hit hard and fast, meaning you'll often find yourself quickly overwhelmed when attacked by more than one enemy. It makes for a frustrating loop in which you're routinely punished for Benedict not being able to react to an enemy's attacks anywhere near fast enough and have to just keep repeatedly banging your head against the same challenge until you're lucky enough to get past it. The platforming gauntlets are also quite the momentum-killers. At certain points in the game, Benedict will be locked into a chase where failing to escape his pursuer is instant death, sending you back to the start of the run. It doesn't matter if you died right at the start or near the end; failing to perfectly execute every jump during these sequences sends you back to square one--in some cases, that's nearly a minute of tense platforming. These sequences wouldn't be too irritating in an actual platformer, but The Last Case of Benedict falters in how poorly its jump mechanic fits platforming challenges. And that's a shame, because here's the thing: I actually like how platforming works in the game--Benedict's demon companion uses its shadowy tentacles to latch onto nearby platforms and pull Benedict forward with a slow momentum. It's visually creepy and narratively cohesive, explaining how an otherwise normal man can double jump. But the floaty and imprecise nature of these jumps does not match the necessary speed and precision for a platforming chase sequence--much like the combat mechanics, there's an irritating disconnect between what the mechanics are and what the game is tasking you to do.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4136649-tenta. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4136649-tenta. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4136649-tenta. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4136649-tenta. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">In response to its shortcomings, The Last Case of Benedict Fox has several excellent approachability settings, allowing you to customize the degree of difficulty for combat, puzzles, and exploration. You can make combat much harder, where enemies take quite a few hits to go down, for example, or go the opposite and decrease the challenge so every enemy (even some bosses!) is defeated in one or two strikes. There's even an invincibility mode, which, when combined with the easier combat setting, essentially removes combat from the game entirely. When I tried playing the game in this way--while also upping the challenge of puzzles and exploration so that I really had to scour every nook and cranny to find the clues I needed--I actually started enjoying the game a lot more. On their own, these approachability systems are great for making The Last Case of Benedict Fox more welcoming to folks who are struggling with any one of the three core gameplay pillars, but they also clearly highlight that combat is holding this game back. When you only have to worry about the puzzles and exploration side of the game, it streamlines the entire experience and makes it easier to appreciate the attention to detail when it comes to the story and art direction. The Last Case of Benedict Fox is one of my favorite flavors of metroidvania: the kind that keeps you guessing all the way up to the end on what's exactly going on. In the first half of the game, it goes too far in terms of setting up its mystery but the narrative payoff in the latter half partially makes up for it. This is the type of game where having a trusty notebook on hand is a good idea because the world design and cryptic story--though wonderful--aren't going to do much to guide you beyond hinting at a potential path forward. The combat and platforming don't quite match the game's intriguing story and wonderful Lovecraftian-inspired art direction, but the game does include ways for you to transform the experience of playing the game to make it more approachable.","length":10602,"tokens":2255,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Last Case Of Benedict Fox Review - Fair Deal","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 10:10AM PDT","content":"Like my favorite metroidvania games, The Last Case of Benedict Fox is built around solving a mystery. It can go too far in its efforts to be deeply mysterious, especially in its first half, but engaging puzzles and unsettling art direction pull you along, even when mediocre combat and platforming mechanics get in the way of the fun. There's an interesting story in The Last Case of Benedict Fox, one wrapped up in an interesting world of supernatural intrigue that I want to know more about. It just takes a while to fully uncover its best parts. In The Last Case of Benedict Fox, you play as the titular detective, who breaks into a strange manor in order to investigate a ritual he wants to perform. The answers he seeks, unfortunately, reside in the minds of a young couple who are now dead. Thankfully, Benedict is connected to an eldritch-like demon who grants him supernatural powers, including the ability to go into the minds of those freshly dead.","content_length":958,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Case Of Benedict Fox Review - Fair Deal","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 10:10AM PDT","content":"Going into Limbo--as Benedict calls it--transports you into a space of sprawling mind palaces, each filled with the deceased's worst nightmares, insecurities, and traumas transformed into physical monsters. As you explore further and farther, you find the necessary memories to unlock new parts of the manor in the real world and piece together the steps to the ritual. If all of that sounds a little convoluted and leaves you with many questions, that seems to be what The Last Case of Benedict Fox is going for, simply dropping you into a densely layered situation without the necessary build-up to fully grasp what's going on. The game holds its cards too close to the chest, unfortunately--going so far as to hide for the entire first half of the game what exactly the ritual that Benedict is researching even does and why he's looking for it. The plot swings way too far past intriguing and mysterious into confusing territory for the first half of its runtime.","content_length":966,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Case Of Benedict Fox Review - Fair Deal","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 10:10AM PDT","content":"This makes for a deeply unwelcoming opening, which sets up a story and character motivations that are difficult to parse, with names, dates, lore, and jargon quickly thrown at you with little in the way of explanation. Once you manage to get a ways into the game, The Last Case of Benedict Fox graciously begins answering a few of the questions it poses, giving you more of a reason for wanting to explore its riveting Lovecraftian-inspired world, but it still just takes way too long to get there. Which is a shame because, as it turns out, The Last Case of Benedict Fox happens to be built upon a fascinating world and deep lore that's begging to be uncovered, a winning recipe for a metroidvania game given the genre's traditional focus on exploration.","content_length":755,"content_tokens":159,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Case Of Benedict Fox Review - Fair Deal","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 10:10AM PDT","content":"Once you're incentivized to go out and map the hallways of people's dying psyches there are a lot of cool supernatural threads to pull on, all styled in a world that feels somehow disturbingly colorful for how heavy its narrative gets. Each part of Limbo is more horrifyingly beautiful than the last. I especially enjoyed how the minds of the people you're jumping into inform each level's unique layout and environmental puzzles. One moment may find you running through a maze composed within the logic of a scientist, for example, the rhythmic clockwork of his dying mind transforming the space with a regular rhythm. And then the next, you're diving into the mind of a woman who died at the end of her emotional rope, with pools of poison, ichor-lined walls, and a frigid underbelly all that remains of her emotionally damaged core.","content_length":835,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Case Of Benedict Fox Review - Fair Deal","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 10:10AM PDT","content":"Exploring these spaces is key to solving The Last Case of Benedict Fox's many environmental puzzles, which is the primary means of progression in the game.

The pages are scattered about the manor, requiring a bit of sleuthing on your part, since whoever designed Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City Police Station clearly was also the architect of this manor--it is filled with an assortment of locks, each hiding secrets that allow you to further explore the manor or uncover more of the story.

There are some obstacles in the world--numeric locks and walls of miasma--that can only be surpassed by unlocking upgrades to Benedict's equipment, requiring you to find specific items in Limbo. Additionally, there are locks in Limbo--like breakable floors and demon-coated doorways--that only your demon companion can overcome, requiring you to get tattoos made from the inky blood carved out from enemies.

The Last Case of Benedict Fox is routinely dragged down by clunky and unrewarding combat mechanics. Benedict is designed as a careful fighter--his repertoire in combat consists of a simple counter, slow melee strikes, a flintlock-like flare gun, and a meanderingly slow healing mechanic. These mechanics don't match the pace of the enemies that Benedict is going up against, as most foes are quite nimble and hit hard and fast, meaning you'll often find yourself quickly overwhelmed when attacked by more than one enemy. It makes for a frustrating loop in which you're routinely punished for Benedict not being able to react to an enemy's attacks anywhere near fast enough and have to just keep repeatedly banging your head against the same challenge until you're lucky enough to get past it.

These sequences wouldn't be too irritating in an actual platformer, but The Last Case of Benedict falters in how poorly its jump mechanic fits platforming challenges. And that's a shame, because here's the thing: I actually like how platforming works in the game--Benedict's demon companion uses its shadowy tentacles to latch onto nearby platforms and pull Benedict forward with a slow momentum.

While this newest entry in the Zelda franchise is most recognizably similar to that 2017 game, it builds upon the foundation so thoroughly and transformationally that it feels like a revelation. This is The Legend of Zelda at its finest, borrowing the best pieces and qualities from across the franchise's history and creating something new that is emotionally resonant, captivating, and endlessly rewarding. Breath of the Wild upended the Zelda formula by presenting a vast and lush open world to explore--a reenvisioning of the unguided experience of the original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Tears of the Kingdom follows in its predecessor's footsteps with a similarly naturalistic setting, but the world has changed in subtle ways. Not everything is exactly the same or where you'd expect it to be, and the map is marked with myriad opportunities for exploration and curiosity. Once again, you'll hardly ever round a corner or crest a hill without finding something else to do or engage with. Hyrule feels serene even as it bustles with life and activity. The score is as majestic as it is unintrusive, accentuating a dire battle or narrow escape with an exciting up-tempo rendition of the theme and then easing off with softer tones to let you breathe in the atmosphere. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Like the Great Plateau in Breath of the Wild, you don't even enter the open world until you've found four key abilities in a tutorial area. Together, these abilities are the engine that drives Tears of the Kingdom--in the same way Breath of the Wild was centered on exploring wilderness using your slate of abilities, these new tools center Tears of the Kingdom around building and experimenting to overcome obstacles in inventive ways. It's a beautifully implemented evolution of what made Breath of the Wild so special. While it's more ambitious than Breath of the Wild in how much you can express your own creativity, it also manages to do this without buckling under its own weight. The two most important abilities are Ultrahand and Fuse, since they serve as the cornerstones of exploration and combat, respectively. Ultrahand lets you piece together just about anything you find, including a vast array of new building materials and ancient Zonai machine parts. Fuse lets you modify your melee weapons, arrows, and shields by attaching things to them in a way that’s thematically similar to Ultrahand. The two act as halves of the same whole, encouraging you to constantly try new versions of a mind-boggling array of combinations, simply to see what happens. Attaching Zonai fan parts to a raft can help it cross a river or make it airborne, depending on how you arrange them. A bomb on an arrow makes for an explosive shot, of course, while one on a shield will be a messy surprise when an enemy tries to hit you, or give you the ability to launch far into the air with a shield-surf. What struck me is how Fuse recontextualizes weapon degradation, which proved divisive in Breath of the Wild. While Fusing items does grant them extra durability to slightly assuage concerns, there's a deeper, more philosophical layer at play with how these new systems interact. Durability in Breath of the Wild was about scarcity and resource management. In Tears of the Kingdom, it feels more about pushing you to try new combinations. When every tree branch or rusty sword you find is a potential test tube for some new experiment, you’re not as precious about each and every object you find. Everything is a toy, and Tears of the Kingdom wants you to play with your toys, smash them together, throw them around, and find joy in the unexpected results. The other two abilities granted in the tutorial area, Recall and Ascend, are more limited in scope but still quite important. Recall--which rewinds objects back to a previous state--has both combat and exploration applications, letting you easily toss a bomb back at some hapless Moblin or cleverly create yourself a moving platform to cross a chasm. Ascend lets you swim upwards through solid rock, easily finding your way into hidden rooms and quickly reaching spaces that would have taken longer (or been impossible) to manually climb. One more key ability is optional--and entirely missable--but grows more important as you build an array of machine parts and take on tougher obstacles. Autobuild, an extension of the Ultrahand ability, simply stitches together the requisite parts for a design you either have saved in your recent history, or one that you've marked as a favorite to save permanently. Rather than reconstructing a hot air balloon or small airplane every time you need one, you can simply construct it using parts that are laying around, and fill in any gaps using the cache of Zonai parts sitting in your inventory. All of these building tools and the Ascend ability effectively deemphasize your stamina meter for climbing, but the construction tools make the game so vertically oriented that it makes traversal flow naturally. That's also due to the Skyview Towers, which serve not just as waypoints for filling out the map, but as cannons to launch you far into the sky. As you ascend, you'll reach another layer of the map, where the Sky Islands reside, with their own secrets to uncover. The sequence in which Link launches into the air is seamless. Rocketing into the sky and then falling back to earth feels thrilling every time, and you can use the vantage point as you descend to float towards a goal or look around for undiscovered landmarks. To my shock, ascending to the sky and then falling back to earth ran smoothly. There has been plenty of concern about the aging Switch hardware being adequate to run Tears of the Kingdom well, and for my part, I barely ever saw a hitch while playing mostly in handheld mode. In fact, the rare instance in which I did notice a slight frame rate dip in both handheld and docked modes wasn't during the big grandiose moments like launching Link into the sky, but rather, a smaller moment like exploring the bustling Kakariko Village during a rainstorm. Even then, the performance dips were minor and temporary. In docked mode, it's easier to spot a loss of some detail on faraway objects when flying high, but the painterly style obscures it well. Leave it to Nintendo to squeeze more technical prowess out of its own systems than seemed possible, this late into its lifespan. (Monolith Soft, which assisted in development, has similarly accomplished incredible feats with Switch hardware, most recently with Xenoblade Chronicles 3.)The map is again littered with landmarks, especially Shrines, which serve double duty as fast-travel points alongside the Skyview Towers. The Shrines are key to upgrading your health and stamina, and as before, these are quick, snack-sized puzzle and combat rooms. I tended to activate them as fast-travel points and then go back to do a string of them in a row. A new, separate consumable can also be used to upgrade your portable battery pack so that your Zonai machines can run that much longer. And in the massive underground area, you can light your own way with Brightbloom seeds and activate special bioluminescent plants that act as their own fast-travel points. This separation between three layers of the open world, each with its own vastly different ambiance, makes exploration truly feel like adventuring in a vast, uncharted world. These tools, and the sprawling world they inhabit, give Tears of the Kingdom a particular flow that feels unique to the Zelda franchise. You aren't simply solving puzzles or fighting battles--you're engineering solutions. You might encounter a gap you can't cross, a fight you can't win, or a puzzle you can't solve. But you know you have the tools, and you know where you can find the materials, and all that's left is to think it through, gather what you need, and put your plan into action. If that plan fails--and sometimes it will--you tweak your design or your plan and you try again. Despite the incredible freedom, it's not overwhelming. While creative solutions are encouraged and might make some challenges much easier, you can certainly make it through the story using simpler designs. It rewards you for flexing your creative muscles, but it meets you where you are. The four major quadrants of the map correspond to the four major dungeons, which this time are more traditional than Breath of the Wild's Divine Beasts. For one thing, in a knowing nod, these ones are actually called Temples, each named after an element like Wind or Fire. They are structurally similar--each revolving around a series of locks in one way or another--but they are wildly different in style and tone. The Thunder Temple segues from an Indiana Jones homage to an extremely traditional Zelda dungeon complete with mirror puzzles, for example. The Wind Temple, meanwhile, takes place in a floating airship with a dense overlapping structure. There are moments in each Temple that feel audacious, like nothing you've seen in a Zelda game before, all intermingled with style and presentation that will please those who, like me, missed the classic-feeling Zelda dungeons in Breath of the Wild. You don't receive a special item in each dungeon that corresponds to its puzzle structure, however. There are no Iron Boots or Boomerangs to be found. Instead, each dungeon features a companion specific to one of the diverse races in Zelda lore, like the Goron or Zora. Your companion effectively grants you their own power on demand for puzzle-solving and combat, making it feel like you've found a special item while also imbuing it with character. Each of the four major characters is lovable in their own way, with fantastic character design that makes them stand out from their brethren. Combat is mostly deemphasized in the Temples, letting you focus squarely on exploration and puzzle-solving for most of their duration. That isn't the case for the bosses, though, which are some of the toughest I've seen in any Zelda game. These ferocious beasts are there to put your skills and companion abilities to the test, and more than once I had to leave a dungeon entirely to better prepare. I was glad to see that Tears of the Kingdom allows for that, and even counts on it, letting you fast-travel out of a dungeon to spend time elsewhere and then easily pick a battle back up when you fast-travel back to the closest waypoint. Your companions don't come with you when you leave, but once you've conquered a dungeon, you'll have their ability to call on from then on. The one drawback of this open structure is that your special abilities can't be counted on to stack on each other. Older Zelda games would eventually ramp up the puzzle difficulty with the wide array of tools at your disposal, because the linear order meant that by the time you reached the sixth dungeon, the game could count on you to have the items from the fourth and fifth dungeons. Since Tears of the Kingdom lets you play dungeons in any order, the puzzles can only be structured around one key ability at a time. This is the trade-off for the open structure, and it's a fine-enough compromise since the game gets plenty of mileage out of its dungeon puzzles regardless. Exploring these dungeons and gathering these allies is all tied back to the central story. Tears of the Kingdom's story is my favorite aspect of the game, and it is absolutely my favorite Zelda story in years. It begins as Link and Zelda investigate a blight, named the Gloom, that seems to be emanating from underneath Hyrule Castle. In an uncharacteristically creepy touch, the two find a desiccated corpse--immediately recognizable to Zelda fans as Ganondorf--being held down by a glowing, disembodied arm. Ganondorf snaps back to life, wounds Link, and breaks the Master Sword. In the ensuing chaos, Zelda falls into inky blackness, and when Link awakens, she's nowhere to be found. In place of his right arm is the one that was found holding Ganondorf. The story goes on to explain that, ages ago, the first King of Hyrule united the Sages--representatives of each race of Hyrule--against the army of the Demon King, Ganondorf. Now, with your new arm, you have the power to reunite the Sages and tap their powers, leading to your cross-country trek to find those with their bloodlines who can fulfill the pacts their ancestors made a millenia ago. Each of these new Sages grapples with the responsibility in their own way, which makes each temple its own small character story with their own individual payoffs. The world of Tears of the Kingdom is one in which diversity is a strength, built on the backs of individuals brave enough to work for a collective good. There's a palpable sense of weight as each of them accept their mantle, some more hesitantly than others. Some are confident leaders who feel beholden by attachments, while others feel guilt-ridden by mistakes or tired of being underestimated. They're some of the strongest tertiary characters in Zelda history--imminently lovable and humane people who each drive home the themes of collective responsibility and the weight of heroism in different ways. Gallery But more than the Sages or even Link, this story truly belongs to Zelda. Your main quest, both in terms of the story and literally in your quest log, is to find Zelda. There's a throughline of mystery to the whole affair, with scattered reports of Zelda sightings across the kingdom. Discovering where she's gone is told in a non-sequential manner, with the mystery slowly unraveling toward an incredible, stirring revelation. There is a specific moment in this story that will go down as one of the most memorable in all of Zelda canon. When I think of the Legend of Zelda series, I've always thought about transcendent, mythic moments: pulling the Master Sword from the pedestal in A Link to the Past, waking the Wind Fish in Link's Awakening, the three major characters representing aspects of the Triforce in Ocarina of Time. Tears of the Kingdom has a moment that matches each of those, and I felt the scope and power of it so strongly that I shed my own tears. As much as I loved each of those pieces in Zelda's past, I'm not sure if it's ever evoked that level of emotion from me before. And then, of course, there is the story you write yourself through gameplay--when you built a clever machine to cross a chasm, explored a dark cavern with only your wits and a handful of arrows, raced through a thunderstorm on horseback to find shelter. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a canvas for your own creativity, a book to write your own stories, a world to create your own legends. It gives you back as much as you put into it, and beckons you to soar, burrow, engineer, solve, adventure, and explore.","length":16944,"tokens":3663,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is so much more than a sequel to Breath of the Wild. While this newest entry in the Zelda franchise is most recognizably similar to that 2017 game, it builds upon the foundation so thoroughly and transformationally that it feels like a revelation. This is The Legend of Zelda at its finest, borrowing the best pieces and qualities from across the franchise's history and creating something new that is emotionally resonant, captivating, and endlessly rewarding. Breath of the Wild upended the Zelda formula by presenting a vast and lush open world to explore--a reenvisioning of the unguided experience of the original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Tears of the Kingdom follows in its predecessor's footsteps with a similarly naturalistic setting, but the world has changed in subtle ways. Not everything is exactly the same or where you'd expect it to be, and the map is marked with myriad opportunities for exploration and curiosity. Once again, you'll hardly ever round a corner or crest a hill without finding something else to do or engage with. Hyrule feels serene even as it bustles with life and activity. The score is as majestic as it is unintrusive, accentuating a dire battle or narrow escape with an exciting up-tempo rendition of the theme and then easing off with softer tones to let you breathe in the atmosphere.","content_length":1395,"content_tokens":278,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Together, these abilities are the engine that drives Tears of the Kingdom--in the same way Breath of the Wild was centered on exploring wilderness using your slate of abilities, these new tools center Tears of the Kingdom around building and experimenting to overcome obstacles in inventive ways. It's a beautifully implemented evolution of what made Breath of the Wild so special. While it's more ambitious than Breath of the Wild in how much you can express your own creativity, it also manages to do this without buckling under its own weight. The two most important abilities are Ultrahand and Fuse, since they serve as the cornerstones of exploration and combat, respectively. Ultrahand lets you piece together just about anything you find, including a vast array of new building materials and ancient Zonai machine parts.","content_length":967,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Fuse lets you modify your melee weapons, arrows, and shields by attaching things to them in a way that’s thematically similar to Ultrahand. The two act as halves of the same whole, encouraging you to constantly try new versions of a mind-boggling array of combinations, simply to see what happens. Attaching Zonai fan parts to a raft can help it cross a river or make it airborne, depending on how you arrange them. A bomb on an arrow makes for an explosive shot, of course, while one on a shield will be a messy surprise when an enemy tries to hit you, or give you the ability to launch far into the air with a shield-surf. What struck me is how Fuse recontextualizes weapon degradation, which proved divisive in Breath of the Wild. While Fusing items does grant them extra durability to slightly assuage concerns, there's a deeper, more philosophical layer at play with how these new systems interact.","content_length":903,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Durability in Breath of the Wild was about scarcity and resource management. In Tears of the Kingdom, it feels more about pushing you to try new combinations. When every tree branch or rusty sword you find is a potential test tube for some new experiment, you’re not as precious about each and every object you find. Everything is a toy, and Tears of the Kingdom wants you to play with your toys, smash them together, throw them around, and find joy in the unexpected results. The other two abilities granted in the tutorial area, Recall and Ascend, are more limited in scope but still quite important. Recall--which rewinds objects back to a previous state--has both combat and exploration applications, letting you easily toss a bomb back at some hapless Moblin or cleverly create yourself a moving platform to cross a chasm.","content_length":827,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Ascend lets you swim upwards through solid rock, easily finding your way into hidden rooms and quickly reaching spaces that would have taken longer (or been impossible) to manually climb. One more key ability is optional--and entirely missable--but grows more important as you build an array of machine parts and take on tougher obstacles. Autobuild, an extension of the Ultrahand ability, simply stitches together the requisite parts for a design you either have saved in your recent history, or one that you've marked as a favorite to save permanently. Rather than reconstructing a hot air balloon or small airplane every time you need one, you can simply construct it using parts that are laying around, and fill in any gaps using the cache of Zonai parts sitting in your inventory. All of these building tools and the Ascend ability effectively deemphasize your stamina meter for climbing, but the construction tools make the game so vertically oriented that it makes traversal flow naturally.","content_length":997,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"That's also due to the Skyview Towers, which serve not just as waypoints for filling out the map, but as cannons to launch you far into the sky. As you ascend, you'll reach another layer of the map, where the Sky Islands reside, with their own secrets to uncover. The sequence in which Link launches into the air is seamless. Rocketing into the sky and then falling back to earth feels thrilling every time, and you can use the vantage point as you descend to float towards a goal or look around for undiscovered landmarks. To my shock, ascending to the sky and then falling back to earth ran smoothly. There has been plenty of concern about the aging Switch hardware being adequate to run Tears of the Kingdom well, and for my part, I barely ever saw a hitch while playing mostly in handheld mode.","content_length":798,"content_tokens":167,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"In fact, the rare instance in which I did notice a slight frame rate dip in both handheld and docked modes wasn't during the big grandiose moments like launching Link into the sky, but rather, a smaller moment like exploring the bustling Kakariko Village during a rainstorm. Even then, the performance dips were minor and temporary. In docked mode, it's easier to spot a loss of some detail on faraway objects when flying high, but the painterly style obscures it well. Leave it to Nintendo to squeeze more technical prowess out of its own systems than seemed possible, this late into its lifespan. (Monolith Soft, which assisted in development, has similarly accomplished incredible feats with Switch hardware, most recently with Xenoblade Chronicles 3.)The map is again littered with landmarks, especially Shrines, which serve double duty as fast-travel points alongside the Skyview Towers.","content_length":892,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"The Shrines are key to upgrading your health and stamina, and as before, these are quick, snack-sized puzzle and combat rooms. I tended to activate them as fast-travel points and then go back to do a string of them in a row. A new, separate consumable can also be used to upgrade your portable battery pack so that your Zonai machines can run that much longer. And in the massive underground area, you can light your own way with Brightbloom seeds and activate special bioluminescent plants that act as their own fast-travel points. This separation between three layers of the open world, each with its own vastly different ambiance, makes exploration truly feel like adventuring in a vast, uncharted world. These tools, and the sprawling world they inhabit, give Tears of the Kingdom a particular flow that feels unique to the Zelda franchise. You aren't simply solving puzzles or fighting battles--you're engineering solutions.","content_length":929,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"You might encounter a gap you can't cross, a fight you can't win, or a puzzle you can't solve. But you know you have the tools, and you know where you can find the materials, and all that's left is to think it through, gather what you need, and put your plan into action. If that plan fails--and sometimes it will--you tweak your design or your plan and you try again. Despite the incredible freedom, it's not overwhelming. While creative solutions are encouraged and might make some challenges much easier, you can certainly make it through the story using simpler designs. It rewards you for flexing your creative muscles, but it meets you where you are. The four major quadrants of the map correspond to the four major dungeons, which this time are more traditional than Breath of the Wild's Divine Beasts. For one thing, in a knowing nod, these ones are actually called Temples, each named after an element like Wind or Fire.","content_length":929,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"They are structurally similar--each revolving around a series of locks in one way or another--but they are wildly different in style and tone. The Thunder Temple segues from an Indiana Jones homage to an extremely traditional Zelda dungeon complete with mirror puzzles, for example. The Wind Temple, meanwhile, takes place in a floating airship with a dense overlapping structure. There are moments in each Temple that feel audacious, like nothing you've seen in a Zelda game before, all intermingled with style and presentation that will please those who, like me, missed the classic-feeling Zelda dungeons in Breath of the Wild. You don't receive a special item in each dungeon that corresponds to its puzzle structure, however. There are no Iron Boots or Boomerangs to be found. Instead, each dungeon features a companion specific to one of the diverse races in Zelda lore, like the Goron or Zora.","content_length":900,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Your companion effectively grants you their own power on demand for puzzle-solving and combat, making it feel like you've found a special item while also imbuing it with character. Each of the four major characters is lovable in their own way, with fantastic character design that makes them stand out from their brethren. Combat is mostly deemphasized in the Temples, letting you focus squarely on exploration and puzzle-solving for most of their duration. That isn't the case for the bosses, though, which are some of the toughest I've seen in any Zelda game. These ferocious beasts are there to put your skills and companion abilities to the test, and more than once I had to leave a dungeon entirely to better prepare. I was glad to see that Tears of the Kingdom allows for that, and even counts on it, letting you fast-travel out of a dungeon to spend time elsewhere and then easily pick a battle back up when you fast-travel back to the closest waypoint.","content_length":960,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Your companions don't come with you when you leave, but once you've conquered a dungeon, you'll have their ability to call on from then on. The one drawback of this open structure is that your special abilities can't be counted on to stack on each other. Older Zelda games would eventually ramp up the puzzle difficulty with the wide array of tools at your disposal, because the linear order meant that by the time you reached the sixth dungeon, the game could count on you to have the items from the fourth and fifth dungeons. Since Tears of the Kingdom lets you play dungeons in any order, the puzzles can only be structured around one key ability at a time. This is the trade-off for the open structure, and it's a fine-enough compromise since the game gets plenty of mileage out of its dungeon puzzles regardless. Exploring these dungeons and gathering these allies is all tied back to the central story.","content_length":908,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/","post_date":"May 11, 2023 at 5:00AM PDT","content":"Tears of the Kingdom's story is my favorite aspect of the game, and it is absolutely my favorite Zelda story in years.

The team says as much with a succinctly stated poster in one of the rooms in its Austin location: \"F**k ladders,\" it reads. The team has said ladders feel limiting by putting players in a \"mode\" where they can't use their weapons or abilities, and they often even fall to their deaths anyway--Arkane hates ladders. And yet, there are ladders early and often in Redfall. This surprise would become emblematic of my time in the vampire-infested Massachusetts town. Redfall is Arkane making compromises to its own design philosophies to serve a genre it may have been better off avoiding. Redfall is a four-player co-op loot-shooter that pits players against vampires and the cultists who follow them. The story premise is classic Arkane stuff, but in practice, it plays like a tug-of-war that its usually inventive team could not win. Most aspects of what the team is known for--unrivaled world design, intricate immersive sim elements, improvisational combat--are rarely found here. In their place are run-and-gun fights with unresponsive AI enemies amid a host of bugs that are so prevalent, it genuinely feels dejecting to see the game launch in this state.

Too often, you and up to three others playing in co-op will move across barren beaches or through wooded areas with little more than some sheds or campsites to rummage through. The game's second map, which you'll unlock halfway through the campaign, is noticeably better because it comes closer to the team's past efforts, with more interesting landmarks and more verticality built into its neighborhoods, but it still doesn't quite get there. Traveling from A to B in creative ways has always been Arkane's signature. And in Redfall, there are opportunities to get crafty when entering some buildings, like by going through the roof, by picking a lock on a door, or by climbing through a window. But moments like these are too spread apart, and in the middle you'll often find blander elements such as small gangs of enemies waiting to be dispatched with no more consideration than choosing which gun to use. In Redfall, you can only really speak one language: killing enemies. There's no reward for creatively completing missions and you're eventually funneled into an all-out firefight in every encounter, even when you take the time to play smarter, discouraging you from trying to solve any problem in a more creative way than just shooting everyone. Redfall pales in comparison to the intricately designed worlds of Arkane's past. Enemies in Redfall are unresponsive to a degree that I would never expect from a team as talented as this and from a publisher as resource-rich as Bethesda. Picking off enemies with a sniper will often result in nearby enemies carrying on with their day, unphased by their allies dying off. In combat, they will often take too long to shoot and struggle to take cover, letting you get in killing blows before they've hardly reacted in any way at all. Even the vampires, who are meant to serve as bigger, tougher enemies, sometimes use attacks that are so easily countered it renders them afterthoughts in many cases, like a lunge that you can just back up to avoid. The stealth mechanics are also underdeveloped. Sneaking up behind an enemy to deliver a knockout blow has no animation of its own. You just whack them the same way you shatter a window, and this method unpredictably leads to some enemies being defeated while others survive the blow and kick off normal combat. Underbosses serve as neighborhood terrorizers whom you must draw out after completing local missions, but in virtually every case, they can be one- or two-shotted on normal difficulty with the game's Stake Launcher, a weapon that is too powerful for the game's own good. Stakes should kill vampires quickly, of course, but because they do, the ubiquity of Stake Launchers nullifies many of the game's encounters. This is a balancing issue that is common in Redfall. Even the game's intended tougher parts, like vampire nests and overpowered enemies called Rooks--who spawn every so often when you've caused too much mayhem--can be overcome pretty breezily in most cases. And when that wasn't the case, often the opposite was true--suddenly overwhelming enemy forces would result in instant death. The game rarely strikes the right balance. Enemy AI is severely lacking, resulting in firefights that are memorable for all the wrong reasons. Redfall is the latest in a long line of games to develop an obsession with loot, but the game struggles to nail even the basic, well-established concept of how that loot should be doled out. In most other loot-heavy games, tiered loot drops on a reliable upward trajectory--early loot grants you common or slightly uncommon weapons, and as you progress, you'll see the loot getting gradually better and rarer. In Redfall, the weapons tend to get stronger, but their rarities follow no pattern. The five color-coded rarities can each drop at any point in the campaign. I was finding purples and golds in the first hour, just as I was finding grays and greens in the final few missions. As such, the loot aspect of Redfall feels faulty and unnecessary. In one perplexing moment during one of the first side missions, a loot drop simultaneously granted me a gray sniper, a green sniper, a blue sniper, and a purple sniper. There are some cool guns to be found, like a UV Beam that turns vampires to stone so you can then blast them to pebbles, but the best guns are notable for their basic functions, not because of RNG-defined perks that have been hamfisted into yet another game. It's easy to see a version of Redfall that has smaller but deeper maps without the loot system. Perhaps that would be too much like the team's other games, which makes Redfall stand out for being different in Arkane’s catalog. But in all the ways it's different, it's worse. Redfall is Arkane making compromises to its own design philosophies to serve a genre it may have been better off avoidingIts story, which is actually full of interesting lore, similarly struggles to leave its mark because of the genre's all-too-common use of stiff quest-givers dishing out instructions as they stand in the same place for the whole game. Arkane's worlds have always been rich with character and environmental storytelling, but Redfall needs to serve its loot-shooter master, so cardboard-like NPCs feign narrative intrigue, leaving the plot to feel like window dressing. What could've been a fun story that basically equates venture capitalists to bloodsuckers is instead nullified by forgettable delivery at nearly every turn. While Arkane's abandonment of its own core design principles is jarring from a fan point of view, you need not have played anything from the team before to be stunned by Redfall's lack of polish. This game is simply not ready, and yet here it is, meant to serve as the spring showcase for Xbox Game Pass. There's really no flavor of bug or glitch I did not encounter: game crashes, A- and T-posing characters, oddly duplicating character models, disappearing quest items, incorrect UI information, texture pop-in--and of course the game's lack of a 60-frames-per-second mode, which was recently a pre-launch headline, too. Redfall sorely misses a higher frame rate, but I saw moments during intensive combat where it struggled to even maintain 30 frames. Prey is six years old and looks better than Redfall. The lack of Arkane's usual flair is disheartening. The presence of so many bugs is just insulting. This game is for sale, but it shouldn't be. The silver lining is faint, but Redfall does have a few things going for it. For one, its foursome of vampire-slaying heroes are all fun to inhabit, not just because of their unique abilities, but their personalities too. The more you complete missions with a particular group of co-op partners, the more your characters will communicate as they build trust. This helps color in their identities which can be difficult in a game--and genre--that is so often focused on filling space and time with things to do to the point of drowning out its heroes. They also play off each other well due to their unique skills. It feels like the studio took its usual protagonist concept and divided it into quarters. This can sometimes mean solo players feel like they're incomplete, existing as only a fraction of Prey's Morgan Yu or Dishonored's Corvo or Emily, but when played in co-op, team synergy shines. Using one hero's ability to teleport over a gap where then another lifts up the team using her elevator-like maneuver to get onto a roof so that a third teammate can drop in through the skylight and cloak past enemies to unlock the front door and let them all in to cause chaos is the sort of player-driven moment that I thought this game would have a lot of. It doesn't have them often enough, but when they occur, the game is at its best.<img alt=\"The way characters play off of each other's strengths is a rare bright spot in Redfall.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4131849-lighthouse. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4131849-lighthouse. png 3840w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4131849-lighthouse. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4131849-lighthouse. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">The way characters play off of each other's strengths is a rare bright spot in Redfall. While the world doesn't feel like the player's canvas in ways you might expect, it is nonetheless a fun place to explore in one very particular way. It leans into its Massachusetts setting in a manner that suggests to me, a native of the state, that someone on the team really likes it there. Moving down cobblestone pathways lined with pumpkins to collect junk loot like legally distinct chainstore donuts and candles that smell of steamed lobster, all while NPCs with thick Boston accents berate each other over the airwaves like they're talking about the Sox, was an authentic touch of home, though I understand few players will get the same enjoyment out of that aspect. Ultimately, Redfall is a game that should not have been released yet. Its litany of bugs hampers the gameplay loop of exploring its world with friends, and that loop itself feels compromised by elements that are poorly executed and ill-suited to the team implementing them. I can't pretend to know whether Arkane chose to make a loot-shooter or was assigned to make a loot-shooter, but I can tell you what it feels like: one of the best game studios in the world suddenly made toothless.","length":13132,"tokens":3022,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Redfall Review - Half-Staked","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/","post_date":"May 1, 2023 at 5:01PM PDT","content":"Arkane doesn't put ladders in its games. The team says as much with a succinctly stated poster in one of the rooms in its Austin location: \"F**k ladders,\" it reads. The team has said ladders feel limiting by putting players in a \"mode\" where they can't use their weapons or abilities, and they often even fall to their deaths anyway--Arkane hates ladders. And yet, there are ladders early and often in Redfall. This surprise would become emblematic of my time in the vampire-infested Massachusetts town. Redfall is Arkane making compromises to its own design philosophies to serve a genre it may have been better off avoiding. Redfall is a four-player co-op loot-shooter that pits players against vampires and the cultists who follow them. The story premise is classic Arkane stuff, but in practice, it plays like a tug-of-war that its usually inventive team could not win.","content_length":873,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Redfall Review - Half-Staked","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/","post_date":"May 1, 2023 at 5:01PM PDT","content":"Most aspects of what the team is known for--unrivaled world design, intricate immersive sim elements, improvisational combat--are rarely found here.

Its litany of bugs hampers the gameplay loop of exploring its world with friends, and that loop itself feels compromised by elements that are poorly executed and ill-suited to the team implementing them. I can't pretend to know whether Arkane chose to make a loot-shooter or was assigned to make a loot-shooter, but I can tell you what it feels like: one of the best game studios in the world suddenly made toothless.","content_length":1012,"content_tokens":213,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor builds on the already-winning formula of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order by making Cal Kestis a more powerful and resourceful Jedi Knight, while also upping the stakes and the challenges he's facing.

The comics describe The High Republic as the golden age of the Jedi. And that may be the case, but we also know this time period will culminate in the Jedi Order led by Master Yoda, who preached to a young Anakin Skywalker that \"fear is the path to the Dark Side.\" Not anger. Not grief. Not any of the other emotions a Jedi is supposed to unhealthily suppress. The events of the High Republic teach the Jedi that fear is the path to evil--the other emotions are just stepping stones along it. Survivor runs with that idea, exploring the concept of fear and what it means for someone like Cal, a survivor of both a war and a genocidal attack on his people, to live with the ever-present shadow of fear. As a survivor of the Jedi Order, Cal fears failing to live up to its ideals, compelling him to go to unhealthy extremes in his fight against the Empire. All the while, he pushes down the growing sentiment he feels for those he loves in order to avoid painful rejection. While the theme of fear and how it can change you is central to Cal's journey, Survivor's main antagonists also benefit from this focus, transforming into foils for Cal to reflect on his actions. On their own, the two big bads lack the level of nuanced characterization I want from a villain--in the end, both boil down to being evil because they're selfish, albeit in different ways. It's not exactly compelling when compared to Fallen Order's terrifying and yet understandably tragic Second Sister. But as foils for Cal, Survivor's villains catalyze his growth. First, forcing him to come to terms with how his reckless pursuit of destroying the Empire and reaching Tanalorr could culminate in his own fall to the Dark Side if he's not careful. And second, recognizing the importance of being a new type of Jedi for a changed galaxy. We've seen variations of these transformations in Jedi before--Luke Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano being the two major examples in the current canon. But in Cal's journey, Respawn delves even deeper into what it means for a Jedi grappling with the doubts and insecurities that everyday people in the Star Wars universe navigate all the time. Cal did not grow up as a normal kid like Luke nor did he have a non-traditional mentor as a padawan like Ahsoka. As a result, his attempts to wrestle with his fears of obsession and commitment are more tenuous and susceptible to outside influence than the Jedi we've seen safely balance their internal light and darkness before. As a result, Cal's conflict with Survivor's villains sees him regularly teetering toward the Dark Side more than the typical Star Wars protagonist (save for Anakin Skywalker, obviously), leaving you guessing up until the final fight of the game as to where Cal's moral compass is eventually going to align. That seesaw ride is so poignant because Survivor's story gives Cal a lot to care about and isn't afraid to see him lose it during crucial narrative beats. The narrative incentive of Survivor isn't a desire to see the good guys win, it's to explore just how much the good guys are willing to throw away on their path to victory. While these new personal challenges require a great deal of growth from Cal to grapple with, the more immediate physical challenges rely on a familiar set of skills and abilities. Survivor smartly avoids the pitfall of depowering its protagonist, meaning Cal starts off with the lightsaber and traversal abilities he earned during Fallen Order. Against the weaker foes of the early game, Cal already feels suitably dominant, as a seasoned Jedi that has been fighting for survival should be. You are empowered to slice through simple Storm Troopers and perform Force-propelled parkour across bottomless pits with ease. These skills don't mean Cal is all-powerful, though, and after an exciting opening chapter, Survivor puts you in your place with an assortment of challenging new enemy types. This encourages you to spend your points wisely in Survivor's branching skill tree to unlock new powers. Much like Fallen Order, Survivor's combat primarily relies on Cal's lightsaber, slicing through an enemy's guard and parrying their strikes until their stamina gives out so you can land some solid hits. It's much easier to discern incoming attacks from fakeouts or preemptive wind-ups in Survivor compared to Fallen Order, and Cal's moves feel sharper and quicker this time around, too. This affords you more control in the heat of battle and helps the game's mostly fast-paced fights feel more surmountable. When an enemy gets a hit in, it now feels more like your mistake and not a stroke of bad luck where the glow of Cal's lightsaber and particle effects of an enemy's weapon muddied the visual language of the parry mechanic. Cal has his own stamina meter to worry about, so combat is as much about control and careful timing as it is about being strategically aggressive. Each battle plays out as a cerebral exercise; the experience evolves with an exciting flow as you get the hang of it, all of which is captured with incredible audio detail. Each carefully deflected blaster bolt resounds with that distinctive Star Wars ping; the hum of Cal's lightsaber and the compressed flux of Force energy help sell the exhilarating thrill of playing as a Jedi Knight. Though BD-1 is still your regular companion who keeps you healed up and unlocks doors, Cal is joined by other characters during certain parts of the story too. Either the blaster-toting Bode or magick-wielding Merrin joins Cal in certain story missions to help him deal with tougher fights. Neither one adds anything especially noteworthy to the experience of combat but they are a welcome resource for crowd control in the tough-as-nails fights in the latter half of the game, and their tag-team takedowns with Cal are all visual delights. To go along with the idea that he's now older and more skilled, Cal also gets two new lightsaber stances in Survivor: Blaster and Crossguard. The former offers Cal a ranged fighting style while the latter deals in slow but heavy strikes. Both have their advantages, but Blaster feels a lot better in motion, matching the other three styles in sense of speed. Cal feels strongest when he's weaving through a crowd of enemies, deflecting blaster bolts and quickly striking his opponent in the moments their guard falters, and that's just trickier to do with the slower Crossguard style. Survivor limits you to only having two lightsaber stances equipped at a time, forcing you to visit a meditation circle checkpoint in order to change them. At times, this restriction can feel frustrating as it funnels how you spend your skill points into the two styles you ultimately end up using most often, thereby discouraging experimentation. And since you only get one free skill respec per playthrough there's little opportunity to explore what could be interesting new abilities and approaches. You can respec after using the freebie, but you have to give up one of your skill points each time. While I initially found this stifling, I came to appreciate how the limitation forced me to adapt to where I did allocate my skill points, especially when it came to lightsaber stances. Each style has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can curate your own take on how Cal fights. You decide where Cal falls short--crowd control, for example, or maybe all-out attack power--and then get creative in how you overcome that weakness. I opted to focus on the jack-of-all-trades Single stance and range-focused Blaster stance, for instance, which made Cal a beast at dueling one-on-one. However, I suffered during combat encounters where the game threw a dozen enemies at a time at me. In those instances, I leaned on Force abilities to help Cal stall certain foes long enough so that I wouldn't be overwhelmed. It felt like I was able to make my own unique version of Cal who specialized in this fun hit-and-run fighting style that ultimately carried me through to the credits. Platforming challenges and Force puzzles return in Survivor as well. Like combat, both feel better in Survivor in comparison to Fallen Order--Cal automatically latches onto climbable surfaces now, and a healthy assortment of unlockable shortcuts means that accidentally missing a jump midway through an action set piece likely won't set you back too far. Survivor has a helpful hint system, too. More importantly, it respects your intelligence, only popping up if you leave the game idling while you're in the midst of a puzzle or you seem stuck. And even then, like Fallen Order, the game will ask if you'd like a hint first instead of just giving you a clue outright--that's a welcome level of restraint. It only offered to give me hints twice, both times during puzzles I just really couldn't figure out where to go or what to do. I don't know how Survivor knew which puzzles I wanted to take the time to figure out and which I desperately needed a clue for, but it did.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Survivor is at its best when every element--story, combat, and puzzle platforming--collides together with frenetic momentum in a way that is quintessentially Star Wars. This is most apparent in one of the game's most memorable highlights, a boss fight about midway through the game. The moment features segments of combat, platforming, and a major narrative payoff, in which Cal and Merrin work together to destroy an Imperial mining tool, combining Jedi abilities and Nightsister magick in a tense, cinematic encounter where your reactions are put to the test and Survivor's absolute banger of a soundtrack is swelling in your ears. It all culminates in the two allies taking down the machine with one of the coolest finishing moves I've seen in any Star Wars project. I actually stood up from my couch and cheered when it happened--you can tell that the team behind this game understands just how cool Star Wars can be. The game makes time for quiet moments too, best seen in another of Survivor's major new features: a hub-like area that Cal can return to frequently. On Koboh, Cal can visit a cantina that fills with NPCs you've saved on your travels across the galaxy. Some of these characters act as vendors, selling Cal cosmetics or optional gameplay perks. Others help Cal liven up the cantina with music or a rooftop garden. The best of them act as quest-givers, pointing Cal towards the puzzle boxes that are High Republic vaults, bounty hunter mini-bosses, or more recruitable NPCs. Even if the characters themselves are, for the most part, narratively flat and boring to talk to, the perks they sell are rewarding and the missions they give you are often fun to complete. Caij Vanda is my favorite--she helps you find the Haxion Brood bounty hunters who are coming for Cal after he escaped their clutches in Fallen Order. These bounty hunters are oftentimes nimble fighters with jetpacks, blasters, deployable shields, and a wide array of gadgets ideally suited for overwhelming a Force user. Tracking them down makes for some fantastically tense duels, and the rewards Caij gives Cal for doing so are some of the best in the game. On a final note, Survivor's technical performance is a stumbling block that must be noted. Playing on Xbox Series X, I experienced random crashes on a number of occasions, all annoyingly during cutscenes before the game had a chance to autosave. On one unlucky (and deeply frustrating) occasion, the game crashed during the cutscene following an especially challenging multiple-phase boss fight that had taken me many attempts to finally beat. Because of the crash, my progress was lost and I had to fight the boss half a dozen times again, earning a victory that felt so much more hollow than the first time I beat him. On PlayStation 5, a colleague reported some occasional stuttering, screen-tearing, and crashing too, and the PC version also has a variety of technical issues relating to in-game presentation, performance, and hardware optimization. Survivor builds on Fallen Order in several meaningful ways, tightening up the combat mechanics, expanding the variety of lightsaber styles, alleviating the frustration of platforming and puzzles, and digging into less-mainstream Star Wars lore to tell a fantastic story about a Jedi trying to defeat a tyrannical evil at all costs and coming to the realization that you can't just fight for good--you have to fight for good in the right way. It's a superb Star Wars game that gets into the nitty-gritty of the struggle of what it takes for a Jedi Knight to begin the journey toward the rank of Master.","length":16730,"tokens":3705,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor builds on the already-winning formula of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order by making Cal Kestis a more powerful and resourceful Jedi Knight, while also upping the stakes and the challenges he's facing.

Neither one adds anything especially noteworthy to the experience of combat but they are a welcome resource for crowd control in the tough-as-nails fights in the latter half of the game, and their tag-team takedowns with Cal are all visual delights. To go along with the idea that he's now older and more skilled, Cal also gets two new lightsaber stances in Survivor: Blaster and Crossguard. The former offers Cal a ranged fighting style while the latter deals in slow but heavy strikes. Both have their advantages, but Blaster feels a lot better in motion, matching the other three styles in sense of speed. Cal feels strongest when he's weaving through a crowd of enemies, deflecting blaster bolts and quickly striking his opponent in the moments their guard falters, and that's just trickier to do with the slower Crossguard style.","content_length":965,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Survivor limits you to only having two lightsaber stances equipped at a time, forcing you to visit a meditation circle checkpoint in order to change them. At times, this restriction can feel frustrating as it funnels how you spend your skill points into the two styles you ultimately end up using most often, thereby discouraging experimentation. And since you only get one free skill respec per playthrough there's little opportunity to explore what could be interesting new abilities and approaches. You can respec after using the freebie, but you have to give up one of your skill points each time. While I initially found this stifling, I came to appreciate how the limitation forced me to adapt to where I did allocate my skill points, especially when it came to lightsaber stances. Each style has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can curate your own take on how Cal fights.","content_length":894,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"You decide where Cal falls short--crowd control, for example, or maybe all-out attack power--and then get creative in how you overcome that weakness. I opted to focus on the jack-of-all-trades Single stance and range-focused Blaster stance, for instance, which made Cal a beast at dueling one-on-one. However, I suffered during combat encounters where the game threw a dozen enemies at a time at me. In those instances, I leaned on Force abilities to help Cal stall certain foes long enough so that I wouldn't be overwhelmed. It felt like I was able to make my own unique version of Cal who specialized in this fun hit-and-run fighting style that ultimately carried me through to the credits.

Survivor has a helpful hint system, too. More importantly, it respects your intelligence, only popping up if you leave the game idling while you're in the midst of a puzzle or you seem stuck. And even then, like Fallen Order, the game will ask if you'd like a hint first instead of just giving you a clue outright--that's a welcome level of restraint. It only offered to give me hints twice, both times during puzzles I just really couldn't figure out where to go or what to do.","content_length":764,"content_tokens":158,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"I don't know how Survivor knew which puzzles I wanted to take the time to figure out and which I desperately needed a clue for, but it did.<img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40.","content_length":542,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"jpeg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4129997-releasedate_screenshot_06_r01_v01_127b0e40. jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Survivor is at its best when every element--story, combat, and puzzle platforming--collides together with frenetic momentum in a way that is quintessentially Star Wars.

It all culminates in the two allies taking down the machine with one of the coolest finishing moves I've seen in any Star Wars project. I actually stood up from my couch and cheered when it happened--you can tell that the team behind this game understands just how cool Star Wars can be. The game makes time for quiet moments too, best seen in another of Survivor's major new features: a hub-like area that Cal can return to frequently. On Koboh, Cal can visit a cantina that fills with NPCs you've saved on your travels across the galaxy. Some of these characters act as vendors, selling Cal cosmetics or optional gameplay perks.","content_length":981,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"Others help Cal liven up the cantina with music or a rooftop garden. The best of them act as quest-givers, pointing Cal towards the puzzle boxes that are High Republic vaults, bounty hunter mini-bosses, or more recruitable NPCs. Even if the characters themselves are, for the most part, narratively flat and boring to talk to, the perks they sell are rewarding and the missions they give you are often fun to complete. Caij Vanda is my favorite--she helps you find the Haxion Brood bounty hunters who are coming for Cal after he escaped their clutches in Fallen Order. These bounty hunters are oftentimes nimble fighters with jetpacks, blasters, deployable shields, and a wide array of gadgets ideally suited for overwhelming a Force user. Tracking them down makes for some fantastically tense duels, and the rewards Caij gives Cal for doing so are some of the best in the game.","content_length":878,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear Itself","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/","post_date":"April 26, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT","content":"On a final note, Survivor's technical performance is a stumbling block that must be noted.

On one unlucky (and deeply frustrating) occasion, the game crashed during the cutscene following an especially challenging multiple-phase boss fight that had taken me many attempts to finally beat. Because of the crash, my progress was lost and I had to fight the boss half a dozen times again, earning a victory that felt so much more hollow than the first time I beat him.

The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is the next expansion of LoL's lore, and it keeps Riot's momentum going with great combat, a beautiful world, and a riveting (though admittedly slow-starting) story. The Mageseeker follows Sylas, a mage living in Demecia, a city that persecutes magic wielders through a special task force called Mageseekers. Sylas has the ability to absorb the magic of other mages, which makes him one of the most powerful magic users in the world. Before he discovered his power, Sylas was a Mageseeker himself, and during one of his assignments, he took pity on one of the mages he was seeking out. However, his innate ability kicked in, and his inability to control the magic he unknowingly absorbed from his quarry resulted in the deaths of multiple innocents.

The minimalist pixel art on display is a far cry from the state-of-the-art graphics modern consoles are capable of--heck, it's even a stark departure from the game's source material. However, the way developer Digital Sun tells a story through this art style, whether it's the backdrop of a scene or subtle movements in characters both playable and not, is remarkable. There's a scene from the beginning of the game that encapsulates how effective this art style can be. Sylas has just escaped his confines and fought his way out of the city. He comes up on a clearing in the forest populated by other escapees who are trying to regroup. There's a lot of hustle and bustle amongst the NPCs, with heads bobbing and other small interactions creating noticeable movement. Sylas decides to address the group by climbing a nearby cliff and pounding the ground to get their attention, and when he does the group goes completely still. It's not overt by any means, but the way the characters freeze in place, heads turned toward the chained mage standing above them, is a brilliant way to organically convey how intimidating Sylas is, which is a tall order considering he's a small, faceless figure on the screen. There are moments like this throughout the entire game--small animation choices that have major ripple effects throughout a scene--and every one of them is executed effectively. Digital Sun clearly knows how to maximize the potential of pixel art, and the evidence is abundant throughout The Mageseeker. Stylish art is great and all, but it means nothing without a solid gameplay foundation to back it up, and The Mageseeker more than delivers in that regard as well. Sylas can either engage enemies with light and heavy attacks, or he can learn and wield a multitude of magic spells found throughout the adventure. You can outfit Sylas with any mixture of learned spells before starting a mission, and that experimentation makes each battle feel uniquely yours. Taking down a big boss with a spell loadout you've chosen makes each victory that much sweeter. Along with collecting spells, there are multiple ways you can enhance Sylas's abilities to your liking. Resources found during missions can be sold to the blacksmith for stat boosts and additional slots for equipping magic. You can also recruit imprisoned mages, who then are assigned to a subgroup representing one of the game's six elements. As more recruits are found, your abilities with each element increase, which give you more power and more options while fighting enemies. Should you realize you've made a wrong spell choice mid-mission, Sylas's unique absorption abilities lets him take a one-use spell from an enemy in the heat of battle. The absorbed spell can be used immediately and directed at any foe, which opens up a new potential strategy with each encounter. For example, many skirmishes will see Sylas fight mages with specifically designated elements, like fire, water, or air. Knowing the weaknesses of each element means you can steal a spell from one enemy, then unleash it on another that is weak to the jacked spell. A common example is seeing fire and ice enemies paired up; use the steal mechanic to take a fire spell, and then launch it at an ice enemy while continuing to attack the fire foe you stole from. The fluidity of battle made each one seem interesting, and more importantly, it kept combat engaging. Boss battles use this ever-flowing system as well, which results in some truly riveting battles against the big bads. Even bosses you encounter more than once would switch things up; the Giant Helm boss, for example, sometimes attacks with different elements than the previous bout, or the arena is set up differently and forces you to adjust. Every boss battle in the game kept me on my toes thanks to never remaining stagnant, as right when I would establish a pattern and get the timing down, a new obstacle would get in my way. This design gives every fight its own unique vibe, and it improves the whole experience in the process. The flowing combat does a lot of heavy lifting for the level design, unfortunately, as stages begin to feel repetitive after a while. Every level in the game follows the same basic principle: Walk through a corridor, enter a larger room when I fight bad guys, and then enter another corridor. Sure, there are some extra paths leading to some hidden loot, but those diversions are fleeting. I wish there were more variety in the stages themselves, as the stellar moments of combat could not hide the uninspiring design. Gallery The game's story starts off slowly, with a few chapters feeling like they could have been combined into one larger mission. The search for Kara, an elder mage who Sylas volunteers to rescue, spans multiple missions with continued breaks in between to head back to camp, which slows any momentum the story had. The campsite in the early going doesn't have a lot going for it, as most of the interesting inhabitants have to be found and recruited as the story progresses. The combo of continued story breaks and an uninteresting hub world in those early hours makes for a frustrating experience. Eventually the story builds into an incredible crescendo, and though it does take a while--the halfway point of the story is where things really kick into high gear--once you're there, it is very hard to put the game down. You still go back to camp after each mission, but even that is more interesting in the later stages of the game, thanks to the added NPCs offering more interactions and dialogue. Considering it took me about 11 hours to complete the game, it's not a massive time investment to get to the good story bits, but it is a shame the entire arc didn't reach the heights of the second half. Riot Games's decision to widen the scope of its marquee franchise has yielded another success in The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story. The pixel art and soundtrack build a beautiful world, while the story--though slow to truly kick off--is riveting once it hits that turning point. There are some issues that hold the experience back, particularly its uneven level designs and the aforementioned slow start to the story. The fluid combat and incredible boss battles, however, make up for those shortcomings, and raise The Mageseeker up to be another effective expansion of the League of Legends lore.","length":9762,"tokens":2155,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story Review - Magic In The Air","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story-review-magic-in-the-air/1900-6418059/","post_date":"April 25, 2023 at 12:13PM PDT","content":"After a decade of resting solely on the laurels of its hit MOBA, Riot Games's decision to expand the lore of the ultra-popular League of Legends and its war chest of playable Champions will likely go down as one of the company's best moves.

Taking down a big boss with a spell loadout you've chosen makes each victory that much sweeter. Along with collecting spells, there are multiple ways you can enhance Sylas's abilities to your liking. Resources found during missions can be sold to the blacksmith for stat boosts and additional slots for equipping magic. You can also recruit imprisoned mages, who then are assigned to a subgroup representing one of the game's six elements. As more recruits are found, your abilities with each element increase, which give you more power and more options while fighting enemies. Should you realize you've made a wrong spell choice mid-mission, Sylas's unique absorption abilities lets him take a one-use spell from an enemy in the heat of battle. The absorbed spell can be used immediately and directed at any foe, which opens up a new potential strategy with each encounter.","content_length":1021,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story Review - Magic In The Air","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story-review-magic-in-the-air/1900-6418059/","post_date":"April 25, 2023 at 12:13PM PDT","content":"For example, many skirmishes will see Sylas fight mages with specifically designated elements, like fire, water, or air. Knowing the weaknesses of each element means you can steal a spell from one enemy, then unleash it on another that is weak to the jacked spell. A common example is seeing fire and ice enemies paired up; use the steal mechanic to take a fire spell, and then launch it at an ice enemy while continuing to attack the fire foe you stole from. The fluidity of battle made each one seem interesting, and more importantly, it kept combat engaging. Boss battles use this ever-flowing system as well, which results in some truly riveting battles against the big bads. Even bosses you encounter more than once would switch things up; the Giant Helm boss, for example, sometimes attacks with different elements than the previous bout, or the arena is set up differently and forces you to adjust.","content_length":905,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story Review - Magic In The Air","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story-review-magic-in-the-air/1900-6418059/","post_date":"April 25, 2023 at 12:13PM PDT","content":"Every boss battle in the game kept me on my toes thanks to never remaining stagnant, as right when I would establish a pattern and get the timing down, a new obstacle would get in my way.

The flowing combat does a lot of heavy lifting for the level design, unfortunately, as stages begin to feel repetitive after a while. Every level in the game follows the same basic principle: Walk through a corridor, enter a larger room when I fight bad guys, and then enter another corridor. Sure, there are some extra paths leading to some hidden loot, but those diversions are fleeting.

The combo of continued story breaks and an uninteresting hub world in those early hours makes for a frustrating experience. Eventually the story builds into an incredible crescendo, and though it does take a while--the halfway point of the story is where things really kick into high gear--once you're there, it is very hard to put the game down.

If it had come as soon as I finished the campaign, I probably would have felt too fatigued. Guerrilla couldn't have predicted the death of actor Lance Reddick, who provided the voice and likeness of the cunning Sylens, so his appearance here is bittersweet. Sylens bookends the experience--both pointing Aloy in the direction of her new quest at the beginning, and stage-setting their next moves at the end. His character even gets an emotional payoff, albeit one that feels like it was written to set up further development in the next game. Still, hearing his inimitable line delivery one more time felt special, knowing that we've lost him.

Upon getting there, she discovers that he's essentially locked down the area with a deadly tower that prevents her flying mount from approaching, and in the process, stranded a set of Quen marines. The setting in Burning Shores is gorgeous. This is post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, but despite the name Burning Shores, it frequently looks picturesque. The city has largely flooded, leaving pockets of islands and skyscrapers jutting out of the ocean. Higher ground like the Hollywood hills provide larger landmasses, but they all have an overgrown, nature-reclaimed look to them. It's unique and eerily beautiful, which describes many of Horizon's settings, but especially when applied to familiar territories like LA. Aside from Londra, the major new character addition in Burning Shores is Seyka, a Quen marine who is somewhat of an outcast from her own military. Aloy sees some of herself in Seyka, as a determined woman who has been shunned by her tribe, and their developing friendship is a major throughline of the story. That especially comes into play as the two investigate Londra, with the sharp-eyed Seyka realizing there must be some reason he's so desperate to get off-planet, and Aloy increasingly straining to avoid telling her about Nemesis. Since all of Aloy's allies learned about the impending threat alongside her, this dynamic of information asymmetry is new and adds a wrinkle to their relationship. Since Burning Shores follows after the main campaign, Guerrilla can count on you to have all of Aloy's tools at her disposal. This is nice, though I'll admit that after such a long absence I had forgotten about some of them. The game helpfully prompted me to use some less-common tools like the Pullcaster when needed, which I appreciated because otherwise I'd be staring at a wall, wondering what I'm supposed to do. There's also one significant new traversal tool--a machine that fires metal posts into a wall to create your own handholds for climbing--but this is limited to a single mission. For the most part, Burning Shores is familiar--you fight machines, you traverse and climb, and then you do it again. There are new weapons and armor available from the Quen at their shops, which require trading a rare new resource.

There are only a few new machines to hunt, including the tiny swarming Stingspawn and the massive toad-like Bilegut. The only other standard machine, the Waterwing, is extremely similar to the existing Sunwing. Still, if you're looking for more opportunity to hunt down resources and pick apart robots, this will keep you occupied. The overgrown wastes of the Hollywood hills. Londra isn't unique as a villain.

Sadly, it's one that doesn't quite pay off in Minecraft Legends as the simple action elements actively detract from the more tantalizing possibilities present on the strategy side. However, it has good ideas outside the story-driven campaign that keep the game from descending into an absolute slog of an experience. In the story campaign, you play as a denizen of the original Minecraft, who is plucked from your time and transported back to an older version of the Overworld that has long since passed into legend. This Overworld is overseen by Foresight, Action, and Knowledge--three deities who each add a dash of charm to an otherwise straightforward story of good versus evil. The simple villagers and animals are under attack by the Piglins, who are constructing portals across the land and building machines that make everything more like the Nether. In a final act of resistance, Foresight, Action, and Knowledge call on you and your building smarts to construct defenses, Golem soldiers, and war machines to slaughter the invading forces. It's a fantastic concept that's made even better when the game dips into the more absurd elements--you can build giant redstone-powered cannons to lay waste to entire battalions of enemy Piglins one explosive shell at a time, for example, or construct ludicrously giant wooden bridges to safely transport troops over whole stretches of mountainous terrain. And having the chance to forge alliances with normally antagonistic Minecraft creatures, like the surprisingly honorable Skeletons and all-too-eager-to-die-for-the-cause Creepers, is also enjoyably silly. To war!As creative as all that is, though, Minecraft Legends simplifies its real-time strategy elements too much for that side of the game to be fun. Although this better highlights the action side of the game, where you battle your enemies alongside your troops, forcing you to split your time between directing your mindless soldiers and actually fighting, this can frequently feel like a distraction as opposed to a seamless and symbiotic back-and-forth. It's not an entirely novel concept, as other games have also moved away from the player being an omnipresent god who looks down upon the world like an all-knowing puppeteer--but it's not executed well here. I like the idea of making the player an everyman general who moves throughout the world and fights alongside their troops. And, in practice, this does create moments of epic warfare. Since you can only direct troops who are following you and you have to walk up to units and give them the \"Follow Me!\" command to get them to fall in line behind you, the start of each battle typically begins with you waving your banner and trumpeting the war to come, and then rushing toward the enemy with dozens of troops at your side. It's a pretty cool feeling to gallop toward a sea of Piglins with a horde of Minecraft creatures at your back, only for both forces to crash into each other with murderous intent. But that feeling of empowerment all comes crashing down once the actual battle is underway. Beyond getting your troops to follow you, the only other command you can give them is to charge. There's some nuance to this command--you can specifically choose to only send one of your melee fighters forward, for example--but there's no way to give orders more specific than that and better take advantage of each unit's unique strengths. The result is a hodgepodge of Minecraft creatures beating the snot out of each other in a jumbled mess, which you can join in on with your trusty sword. It's funny the first handful of times, but after that, it's just the tedium of repeating the cycle: summoning troops, sending them off to battle, creating more troops, and leading them to the grinder. Frustratingly, you can't build on the land corrupted by the Nether, either, meaning most of every battle is spent running back and forth between the actual fray and greener pastures where you've set up the spawners for your troops. You can unlock a way to revert Nether-corrupted blocks back to their normal state, creating a way to build resources closer to the fight, but it's tedious and grinds the excitement of battle to a halt. Minecraft Legends' story campaign isn't that great. The game gently forces you to contend with that tedium, however. Your troops are brainless without you, and if they finish destroying an enemy structure or killing all the enemies in an area, they'll sit there and wait for you to direct them again. To keep the battle in your favor, you have to regularly get into the mix and tell your soldiers to go here, and now there, and now over here. Admittedly, this is how most real-time strategy games work, but the big difference with Minecraft Legends is that you aren't quickly jumping around the battlefield. Instead, you have to gallop on your horse to reach each group, slowing your ability to quickly command multiple units and making it difficult to put strategies into motion. There's no way to give orders from a distance or call your soldiers to come to your side either. The most you can do is go up to one of the unit spawners you've created, where you have the option to recall all soldiers to you. And that's not something you regularly want to do since, again, your spawners are usually built a Nether field away from the fight at hand--calling all your soldiers to you would only remove them from the battle you're planning on leading them to. In the moment-to-moment gameplay, leaving the battle to spawn more troops or command your redstone cannons can mean leaving your soldiers alone for a whole minute at a time--potentially a death sentence for those under your command. If you don't take steps to cleanse the Nether--especially around larger Piglins bases where the field of Nether that extends around them is massive--you won't be able to move your structures closer to the actual battle, and you'll end up spending most of the fight just running back-and-forth between the Piglins base and yours, barking out general orders to whoever is still alive every time you return to the front lines. The reward for going through the effort of capturing an enemy base is worth it at least. Stopping the Piglins in their tracks is the only way to earn the necessary resources for expanding your inventory or unlocking the necessary tools to gather the resources to build new types of units and structures. You still run into the same problem of not being able to easily build them close to where you want them, but it's always nice to have new toys to play with.<img alt=\"Building and defending bases are the best part of Minecraft Legends.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4127619-base. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4127619-base. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4127619-base. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4127619-base. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Building and defending bases are the best part of Minecraft Legends. When you're not waging war or enduring a siege, most of your time in Minecraft Legends' story campaign is spent exploring the world and collecting resources. The world is colorful and vibrant, with Minecraft's recognizable blocks stacked into gorgeous vistas, precarious canyons, murky swamps, and majestic forests. Unlike Minecraft, you don't have to mine individual blocks to gather their contents. Instead, you have a select amount of tiny helpers you can direct to collect all the available resources in a given space and automatically add them to your inventory. This is especially helpful in combat situations when you're running low on resources, as you can run out to a nearby forest or cliff face and command your helpers to gather wood and stone while you return to the fray. That said, a big part of Minecraft's slow but personal resource-collecting process is that it encourages you to really explore and understand the world you've fallen into--you come to know it after spending many hours in it. In comparison, I don't feel such a connection to the world of Minecraft Legends, as this truncated variation of the original game's resource-collecting system is far less personal and intimate. It's not a bad system by any means--it works as intended--but I couldn't shake the feeling that a crucial part of the Minecraft experience was lost. A lot of the issues in the story campaign are mediated by the drop-in/drop-out co-op multiplayer where a combination of players can work together, splitting their attention between commanding soldiers and building structures. For the player wanting (or needing) to play Minecraft Legends solo, however, there's no easy way to avoid the shortcomings of the combat mechanics. Granted, these shortcomings are largely the result of Minecraft Legends simplifying the oftentimes systems-heavy gameplay loop of real-time strategy games to be more approachable and welcoming to players new to the genre. And that is great. Nonetheless, the campaign doesn't build beyond these simple beginnings to address its shortcomings--whether with more complex systems or something else--causing the gameplay loop of the story campaign at least to stagnate, especially if you're playing on your own. As you wage war on the Piglins, they in turn enact their own machinations, slowly spreading their influence across the continent. Each army is overseen by a different general with their own brand of fighting, whether that's building especially high walls and numerous defenses or implementing a nimble fighting force that quickly moves across the land in pursuit of any perceived threat. As each army expands, they'll mount attacks on peaceful villages under your protection. Early warning systems will alert you to these attacks, allowing you to travel to an ally under siege and defend them, flipping the normal combat loop and putting you on the defensive. Minecraft Legends' combat works way better under this format. Each village is small enough to keep you close to both the battle at hand and the structures you've built, but since Piglins can attack from any direction and typically do so in waves, it forces you to still be strategic. Do you use the last of the wood in your inventory to shore up that wall that's about to break in this wave, for instance, or is it better spent building more unit spawners in preparation for the next wave? It's also easier to take advantage of the game's ability to disassemble structures to recoup resources and build them somewhere else when you have a more comprehensive view of your surroundings and the state of the battle. If you defend friendly villages, their inhabitants will gather rare Minecraft blocks like iron and redstone as thanks, incentivizing you to keep checking up on them and stop any approaching Piglin armies.<img alt=\"It's certainly a pretty game.\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4127621-temple. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4127621-temple. png 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4127621-temple. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4127621-temple. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">It's certainly a pretty game. You can find more of this tower defense format in Minecraft Legends' first Lost Legends, Portal Pile. Lost Legends are post-launch challenges that will release on a monthly basis. Portal Pile is a 10-wave tower defense mission where you have to defend a single village from a massive Piglin horde spilling out of three separate portals for as long as you can. This mission escalates Minecraft Legends' challenge significantly, encouraging you to make snap decisions and respond to threats with ingenuity instead of brute force. It's a lot of fun, especially if you've got a partner or two working with you to make the mission more surmountable. I'm sure it's possible to complete all 10 waves on your own but I haven't managed to do it--if this first Lost Legend is any indication, these post-launch challenges will be far more difficult and strategy-oriented than the gameplay loop of the story campaign. Only having one of these at launch means this option grows stale fairly quickly for audiences wanting something more than the easy-to-pick-up but shallow gameplay of the main story campaign, but it's far and away the most enjoyment I've found in Minecraft Legends and a hopeful indication of the game's future. Additionally, Minecraft Legends has a Versus mode for players hoping to take the skills they've accumulated in the story campaign and use them on others in PvP. Versus sees six to eight players in teams of three or four face off. Each side must work together to defend their tower while attacking the opposing team's tower, taking any wandering Piglin into account as well. I like the set-up of Versus--especially since an opposing player can prove to be a more clever opponent than a bunch of Piglin--but oftentimes the mode suffers from putting opposing bases far apart, giving time for both teams to build rows of walls and dozens of arrow-firing towers. At that point, the flow of the match can stall into a stalemate as both sides just throw their respective units at each other in the hope of breaking the deadlock. Ground gained can be quickly dashed by an opponent shoring up a broken wall or building another arrow-firing tower. It's far faster to build structures than it is to destroy them, meaning two well-defended fortresses can each endure for quite a while--sometimes long enough for players to get fed up enough to just leave the match. There's a lot of good in Minecraft Legends. The absurdity of the game is delightful at times and the tower-defense elements in both the story campaign and the first Lost Legends challenge are a taste of how the combat system can excel in the right scenario. But the story campaign's regular gameplay loop of tracking down enemy bases and overthrowing them can become tedious, especially in battles when there's a huge field of Nether between you and your foe. Gathering resources, while enjoyably quick and easy, feels so impersonal as well, making it difficult to appreciate the vibrant world you're slowly chiseling away in your war with the Piglins. The pieces to a good game are here; they just aren't yet built into a structure sound enough for me to want to spend a lot of time in it.","length":14821,"tokens":3162,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Minecraft Legends Review - Tides Of War","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/","post_date":"April 19, 2023 at 11:31AM PDT","content":"Taking the world and characters of the original Minecraft, a sandbox block builder, and putting them into a real-time strategy game with action elements is--while certainly a cool-sounding idea--an experimental move. Sadly, it's one that doesn't quite pay off in Minecraft Legends as the simple action elements actively detract from the more tantalizing possibilities present on the strategy side. However, it has good ideas outside the story-driven campaign that keep the game from descending into an absolute slog of an experience. In the story campaign, you play as a denizen of the original Minecraft, who is plucked from your time and transported back to an older version of the Overworld that has long since passed into legend. This Overworld is overseen by Foresight, Action, and Knowledge--three deities who each add a dash of charm to an otherwise straightforward story of good versus evil.","content_length":899,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Minecraft Legends Review - Tides Of War","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/","post_date":"April 19, 2023 at 11:31AM PDT","content":"The simple villagers and animals are under attack by the Piglins, who are constructing portals across the land and building machines that make everything more like the Nether.

It's a fantastic concept that's made even better when the game dips into the more absurd elements--you can build giant redstone-powered cannons to lay waste to entire battalions of enemy Piglins one explosive shell at a time, for example, or construct ludicrously giant wooden bridges to safely transport troops over whole stretches of mountainous terrain.

It's not an entirely novel concept, as other games have also moved away from the player being an omnipresent god who looks down upon the world like an all-knowing puppeteer--but it's not executed well here.

It's a pretty cool feeling to gallop toward a sea of Piglins with a horde of Minecraft creatures at your back, only for both forces to crash into each other with murderous intent. But that feeling of empowerment all comes crashing down once the actual battle is underway. Beyond getting your troops to follow you, the only other command you can give them is to charge.

Frustratingly, you can't build on the land corrupted by the Nether, either, meaning most of every battle is spent running back and forth between the actual fray and greener pastures where you've set up the spawners for your troops.

Admittedly, this is how most real-time strategy games work, but the big difference with Minecraft Legends is that you aren't quickly jumping around the battlefield.

When you're not waging war or enduring a siege, most of your time in Minecraft Legends' story campaign is spent exploring the world and collecting resources. The world is colorful and vibrant, with Minecraft's recognizable blocks stacked into gorgeous vistas, precarious canyons, murky swamps, and majestic forests. Unlike Minecraft, you don't have to mine individual blocks to gather their contents. Instead, you have a select amount of tiny helpers you can direct to collect all the available resources in a given space and automatically add them to your inventory. This is especially helpful in combat situations when you're running low on resources, as you can run out to a nearby forest or cliff face and command your helpers to gather wood and stone while you return to the fray.","content_length":924,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Minecraft Legends Review - Tides Of War","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/","post_date":"April 19, 2023 at 11:31AM PDT","content":"That said, a big part of Minecraft's slow but personal resource-collecting process is that it encourages you to really explore and understand the world you've fallen into--you come to know it after spending many hours in it. In comparison, I don't feel such a connection to the world of Minecraft Legends, as this truncated variation of the original game's resource-collecting system is far less personal and intimate. It's not a bad system by any means--it works as intended--but I couldn't shake the feeling that a crucial part of the Minecraft experience was lost. A lot of the issues in the story campaign are mediated by the drop-in/drop-out co-op multiplayer where a combination of players can work together, splitting their attention between commanding soldiers and building structures.

Nonetheless, the campaign doesn't build beyond these simple beginnings to address its shortcomings--whether with more complex systems or something else--causing the gameplay loop of the story campaign at least to stagnate, especially if you're playing on your own. As you wage war on the Piglins, they in turn enact their own machinations, slowly spreading their influence across the continent. Each army is overseen by a different general with their own brand of fighting, whether that's building especially high walls and numerous defenses or implementing a nimble fighting force that quickly moves across the land in pursuit of any perceived threat.

Do you use the last of the wood in your inventory to shore up that wall that's about to break in this wave, for instance, or is it better spent building more unit spawners in preparation for the next wave?

While the first Advance Wars hasn't aged as well as its sequel, both games are nevertheless elevated by Re-Boot Camp's robust suite of game modes, the local and online multiplayer, and an intuitive map editor. As a package, there is plenty to do, see, and unlock, and it's all held together by a fantastic presentation that evokes Saturday morning cartoons and colorful board games. Foundationally, the Advance Wars flavor of turn-based tactical combat holds up well. In its most rudimentary form, two commanding officers hailing from different fictional countries move units around a map to wipe out enemies and capture key areas. Each unit, however, has strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered for both individual firefights and multi-turn campaigns. For example, Infantry and Mech units are the only units that can capture cities, airports, seaports, and bases. They are instrumental to securing victory, but their movement is limited and they are weak to just about everything. APCs, Transport Copters, and Landers can ferry Infantry and Mechs great distances, but they need the protection of other units due to their inability to attack. Of course, the units tasked with this responsibility also have their own set of strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered. Tanks can be devastating at close range, but long-range Rockets can make short work of them. Artillery can clean up enemies at medium range, but they are useless at close range. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The basics, such as commanding units and capturing cities, are handled in an optional Field Training menu, which can be accessed in both games. However, the first handful of missions in both campaigns also act as tutorials and run through the basics of armored, naval, and aerial warfare. These tutorials do a great job at showing you the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, but a lot of the same info is covered twice. This means that the early hours of Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising can drag on a bit if you start with the first game. Most missions demand keen tactics, careful resource management, and a decent understanding of how each unit operates. From there, you need to balance your short-term goals alongside your long-term ones, while identifying potential threats and keeping a close eye on your enemy. Some missions give you a fixed amount of units to work with, while others are dotted with points of interest that allow you to purchase new units. Both mission types feel very different from one another; the former plays out more like a puzzle where you have to achieve victory using only what's available to you, while the latter feels more free-form since you can invest in any unit you'd like. A unit's strengths and weaknesses don't account for everything, though, and terrain can be just as important. Mountains offer extra protection for Infantry and Mechs, while cities protect and repair land-based units. Roads give certain units more movement range, while reefs can obscure ships and submarines from enemy sightlines. Although superior terrain can’t save an Infantry unit from a tank, it can offer just enough protection for the infantry to hang on for an extra turn. This makes battles feel a bit more dynamic as you advance on an enemy or set up ambushes. Each country is also backed up by a handful of colorful commanding officers, or COs, who have unique passive skills and abilities that range from powering up units to changing the weather. The COs add an extra layer of depth and unpredictability to combat that forces you to stay on your toes. You could be gaining ground against Eagle, the cunning CO from Green Earth, only for him to activate his Lightning Drive ability that allows his vehicular units to move and attack a second time. Not all of these COs are balanced in a multiplayer setting, but in the campaign, they do force you to think ahead and respond effectively when your rival activates their superpower. As a package, there is plenty to do, see, and unlock, and it's all held together by a fantastic presentation that evokes Saturday morning cartoons and colorful board gamesWhat really ties everything together is its charming presentation. The cast of COs feels as though it’s been lifted from an old cartoon and given a fresh coat of paint, while each unit looks like it’s been unearthed from the bowels of a toy chest. This is backed by a catchy, energetic score that swings from rock and roll to jazz. While the fundamentals of Advance Wars are strong, the first Advance Wars does a poor job of making use of all these mechanics. Throughout the story, you are introduced to nine different COs, but you can only use three for a majority of the campaign. On top of that, most missions are relatively straightforward: Defeat all the enemy units, capture the enemy's capital, or survive for a certain number of days. The units at your disposal will differ depending on the mission, but after a while, missions start to get longer and blend together due to the lack of objective variety. By the end, some missions can drag on for hours as you and your opponent get locked into a battle of attrition where no one faction can gain any significant ground. The lack of a proper rewind feature--something that has become popular in modern strategy game design--also means that if you make a mistake, sometimes the best course of action is to restart the battle, which could cost you hours over the duration of a campaign. You can correct minor mistakes by resetting your turn in the menu, but resetting a turn can't save you from a tactical error you made a few turns back. This makes it risky to try out different strategies or experiment with different units. While Advance Wars 2 occasionally suffers from the same issue, the campaign itself is excellent. It improves upon Advance Wars in almost every way. There's more mission variety, you are constantly trying out different COs, and the map design is much better at encouraging you to try different units and mechanics. One of my favorite missions has you defend your capital from an onslaught of enemy tanks and infantry. You are outgunned and outnumbered, and because the capital is surrounded by mountains, most of your units can't even access it. This means you must indirectly cut down the enemy before a unit reaches the capital. It's a thrilling skirmish that requires you to quickly assess threats, carefully position your units, and manage your resources. Not every mission is as good as this one, but many of them come pretty close. Fortunately, you can skip right to Advance Wars 2 if you'd like. The game will advise you not to due to story spoilers, but the plots of both games are unremarkable. There's a bit of dialogue before and after each battle, as well as a couple cutscenes, but combat is the main event, and since it really hits its stride in Black Hole Rising, I don't think you'd miss much by skipping the first game altogether--especially since both games kick off with a tutorial and the difficulty ramps up at a similar pace. As you play through the campaigns, you'll earn coins that can be spent at Hachi's Shop in the main menu. Here you can purchase music from the excellent soundtrack, artwork, and new Battle Maps and COs that can be used in some of Re-Boot Camp's additional modes. One of the standout modes for this is local multiplayer. You can play with multiple consoles via local connection, or you can play on one console by passing the controller. This is where Advance Wars really leans into board game aesthetics. Gathering around a TV with friends, passing the controller back and forth as everyone vies for control, feels like the way Advance Wars was meant to be played. There are dozens of multiplayer maps and a bunch of COs that keep combat fresh for each battle, so multiplayer does have some longevity. There's even a great map editor that lets you create and share fully functioning maps in minutes. The sharing capabilities are pretty limited, allowing you to only share with friends. Gallery Online plays similarly with up to two players; however, the lack of an asynchronous multiplayer mode seems like a huge missed opportunity. Battles can drag on as turns get longer and longer, and without that communal feel of local multiplayer, it can be painfully slow. A mode that allows you and your friends to take turns at your leisure would have been perfect for this style of turn-based combat. What makes Advance War 1+2: Re-Boot Camp an exciting prospect today is the same as what made the games compelling when they were first released: fun and approachable strategic gameplay that is built on a solid foundation. While the first title certainly shows its age in the latter stages, the moments of magic that earned Advance Wars a passionate fan base are still there.

Mountains offer extra protection for Infantry and Mechs, while cities protect and repair land-based units. Roads give certain units more movement range, while reefs can obscure ships and submarines from enemy sightlines.

Dead Island 2 is a first-person action-RPG set against the backdrop of the same zombie plague that caused mayhem in the original game's story. It moves the series away from its fictional island of Banoi and brings it to Los Angeles--which, you may recall, is definitely not an island. It's an odd move given the franchise's name, but a forgivable one once you begin to explore, as the semi-open world of the game's story and setting prove to be one of its greatest aspects. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Dead Island 2 shirks a true sandbox-style open world in favor of smaller but more authored locales with far fewer repeating elements. It's ultimately a benefit to the game, as it tends to strike an engrossing balance between width and depth. The game's world design relies on indirect routes. While exploring the pier, fences will cause you to duck through the arcade and past the bumper cars to get to the other end, creating new set pieces and keeping you zig-zagging through the unpredictable world. On the beach, storefronts are often explorable, rewarding you with great weapons, cash for upgrades, or other optional secrets. There are few straight paths through LA, and around every corner you'll find more monsters and the treasures they loom over. Backtracking is common, especially when tackling the game's 40+ side missions alongside its 24 main quests. Your first time through any zone, you won't be able to see and do everything, and the many locked doors you'll leave behind make retreading your steps a rewarding effort, as side quests open up new avenues consistently. Getting through the world of \"HELL-A\" isn't just about walking the Venice Beach boardwalk or trekking down the lavish Beverly Hills. Chiefly, it's about bludgeoning, beheading, maiming, or otherwise decommissioning the countless zombies who get in your way. Dead Island 2 does an excellent job of evolving its first-person combat by way of both ample enemy and weapon variety, as well as a satisfying combat system that feels weighty and well-considered. I was still discovering new weapons even after I beat the main story, including some named weapons that represent the game's best loot available. Each weapon, be it a firefighter's axe, a wrench, a baseball bat, or one of many others, feels different, and the crafting system contains dozens of blueprints that can customize each weapon several times over, giving them familiar but still exciting status effects, as well as buffs to your chosen \"Slayer\" of the game's roster of six heroes. With so much weapon variety, the zombies do well to match. The early distinction between walkers, runners, and shamblers doesn't take long to give way to hulk-like crushers, disorienting screamers, and much more. Dambuster stays true to the mythos of the original game by reintroducing many of the same classes of zombies, albeit now with more variety in their unique immunities, like electrified screamers who can't be killed with electricity since, well, that's already their whole deal. Even then, the game also introduces several new types of undead not previously seen in the series, too. Even the game's narrower, more linear zones feel full of stories to uncover. Adding weight and variety to the combat is great, but it's not really new to the genre. Dead Island 2's secret weapon is its highly detailed damage model--something Dambuster can hang its hat on. Every single enemy in the game exists like the world's grossest onion, with each layer able to be peeled away via katana, mallet, or anything else you'll equip. Smash a zombie with a baton and the skull will crumble away to reveal the brain, or perhaps their jaw will hang loose like keys on a lanyard. Frying them to a crisp with electricity or melting away their skin with an in-universe sludge called Caustic-X will provide markedly different results. This makes it so not only do you need to consider how and where to inflict damage upon every single enemy in the game, but every slash, gash, and bash will be accounted for. It's unlike anything I've seen in a zombie game, and I've played dozens of them. I've never really been into gore for gore's sake, but even I'll admit that there's a special type of flair to punching a hole through the head of a zombie with homemade Wolverine claws that you just don't see in the genre very much, regardless of the medium. Combining all of the exciting weapons with the highly varied hordes of zombies makes each encounter a conscious effort. Rarely is it the case where you can turn your brain off and bash through a collection of undead to get to an objective they're blocking. Each fight takes a concerted, thoughtful approach--and to my surprise, it stays tough all the way through. All this praise is not without some caveats, however. For one, that difficulty can sometimes wade into feeling unfair. Enemies spawn quickly, and the game rarely lets you rest. In the game's two- or three-player co-op, this is usually fine, as you have helping hands, and it gives the world a sense of insecurity that a zombie plague should provide. But in single-player, some of the encounters, as well as the relentless enemy-spawning, may leave you feeling like you're swimming upstream in a river of blood and viscera. Sometimes a particular enemy will be the focus of your objective, and though the game does well to telegraph this, it can be tough to push through the horde to get to the one whose re-death will actually halt the horde from persisting. Secondly, none of my praise for the game's melee combat can be applied to its gunplay. Guns start to crop up in the game about a third of the way through the story, and though there is also plenty of variety in these weapons--made deeper by player-driven customizations--guns are unwieldy and often feel like a liability. Oddly, they feel better to use when fired from the hip rather than aiming down their sights. There's a cumbersome unpredictability whenever the sight is used, which creates a discrepancy between where you were targeting from the hip and where you may then be targeting from the sight. It behaves like recoil that occurs before you've even fired a shot. This slows down gunplay as it means constantly re-lining up shots whenever you choose to aim in the first place, and though that should at least mean the shotguns of the world are fine since they hardly require aiming, they always felt underpowered. Melee combat and gunplay represent the game's best and worst parts, respectively. Gallery The game's best gun, the hunting rifle, was my go-to when I felt like I had to use any firearms, but even then I'd just try to line up headshots from the hip, knowing that aiming more than that would likely just cause me to waste ammo. Still, you can feasibly beat the game using few to no guns at all, and you may be better off for it. Exploration, combat, and upgrades all shine, which is helpful when the story is so forgettable. Though the sequel is written by a different team than the original, Dead Island 2's writing suffers from problems that tie them together like a familiar bouquet of unexplained motivations, grating dialogue, and a bad final act that races past a would-be charming level of campiness and crashes into groan-inducing territory. I would be hard-pressed to name nearly any character other than my selected hero, Amy, or Sam B., who reprises his role from the first game. A fictional actor named Emma Jaunt plays a central part, too, and a shadowy legion of anti-heroes routinely pops up to mime narrative intrigue, but none of it amounts to anything. The spirit of the story is fun in a Grand Theft Auto sort of way, in that it targets, above all others, rich American socialites as the butt of its jokes. Though some of these characters are made out to be good people, the writing often revels in sending zombie teeth barreling for the jugulars of streamers, actors, and others deemed to be the vapid wealthy elite. But this is merely the air of storytelling. It lets the world feel lived in, and it actually makes some of the many collectibles enjoyable to read, but whenever cutscenes would threaten to tell a story, I found myself groaning like the undead. For a game in development for more than a decade, it's a minor miracle for Dead Island 2 to come out at all. The fact that it's arrived in such a state that players can have fun with it for the duration of its story and beyond--even as that story itself is an afterthought--is a testament to the team that got it to a once-unlikely finish line. Along with the lackluster story, poor gunplay and some balancing issues hurt Dead Island 2, but its deep melee combat systems and rich setting make it a better game than the original, which is maybe the most important thing I can say about it after everything it's been through.","length":11278,"tokens":2559,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Dead Island 2 Review - Eat The Rich","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/","post_date":"April 18, 2023 at 7:08AM PDT","content":"Games labeled as being in \"development hell\" rarely release in a state anyone would want to experience--if they release at all.

Dead Island 2 is a first-person action-RPG set against the backdrop of the same zombie plague that caused mayhem in the original game's story. It moves the series away from its fictional island of Banoi and brings it to Los Angeles--which, you may recall, is definitely not an island.

It's ultimately a benefit to the game, as it tends to strike an engrossing balance between width and depth. The game's world design relies on indirect routes. While exploring the pier, fences will cause you to duck through the arcade and past the bumper cars to get to the other end, creating new set pieces and keeping you zig-zagging through the unpredictable world. On the beach, storefronts are often explorable, rewarding you with great weapons, cash for upgrades, or other optional secrets. There are few straight paths through LA, and around every corner you'll find more monsters and the treasures they loom over.

Getting through the world of \"HELL-A\" isn't just about walking the Venice Beach boardwalk or trekking down the lavish Beverly Hills. Chiefly, it's about bludgeoning, beheading, maiming, or otherwise decommissioning the countless zombies who get in your way. Dead Island 2 does an excellent job of evolving its first-person combat by way of both ample enemy and weapon variety, as well as a satisfying combat system that feels weighty and well-considered.

With so much weapon variety, the zombies do well to match. The early distinction between walkers, runners, and shamblers doesn't take long to give way to hulk-like crushers, disorienting screamers, and much more. Dambuster stays true to the mythos of the original game by reintroducing many of the same classes of zombies, albeit now with more variety in their unique immunities, like electrified screamers who can't be killed with electricity since, well, that's already their whole deal.","content_length":833,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Dead Island 2 Review - Eat The Rich","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/","post_date":"April 18, 2023 at 7:08AM PDT","content":"Even then, the game also introduces several new types of undead not previously seen in the series, too. Even the game's narrower, more linear zones feel full of stories to uncover. Adding weight and variety to the combat is great, but it's not really new to the genre. Dead Island 2's secret weapon is its highly detailed damage model--something Dambuster can hang its hat on. Every single enemy in the game exists like the world's grossest onion, with each layer able to be peeled away via katana, mallet, or anything else you'll equip. Smash a zombie with a baton and the skull will crumble away to reveal the brain, or perhaps their jaw will hang loose like keys on a lanyard. Frying them to a crisp with electricity or melting away their skin with an in-universe sludge called Caustic-X will provide markedly different results.","content_length":831,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Dead Island 2 Review - Eat The Rich","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/","post_date":"April 18, 2023 at 7:08AM PDT","content":"This makes it so not only do you need to consider how and where to inflict damage upon every single enemy in the game, but every slash, gash, and bash will be accounted for. It's unlike anything I've seen in a zombie game, and I've played dozens of them. I've never really been into gore for gore's sake, but even I'll admit that there's a special type of flair to punching a hole through the head of a zombie with homemade Wolverine claws that you just don't see in the genre very much, regardless of the medium. Combining all of the exciting weapons with the highly varied hordes of zombies makes each encounter a conscious effort. Rarely is it the case where you can turn your brain off and bash through a collection of undead to get to an objective they're blocking. Each fight takes a concerted, thoughtful approach--and to my surprise, it stays tough all the way through.

Enemies spawn quickly, and the game rarely lets you rest. In the game's two- or three-player co-op, this is usually fine, as you have helping hands, and it gives the world a sense of insecurity that a zombie plague should provide. But in single-player, some of the encounters, as well as the relentless enemy-spawning, may leave you feeling like you're swimming upstream in a river of blood and viscera. Sometimes a particular enemy will be the focus of your objective, and though the game does well to telegraph this, it can be tough to push through the horde to get to the one whose re-death will actually halt the horde from persisting. Secondly, none of my praise for the game's melee combat can be applied to its gunplay.","content_length":791,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Dead Island 2 Review - Eat The Rich","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/","post_date":"April 18, 2023 at 7:08AM PDT","content":"Guns start to crop up in the game about a third of the way through the story, and though there is also plenty of variety in these weapons--made deeper by player-driven customizations--guns are unwieldy and often feel like a liability. Oddly, they feel better to use when fired from the hip rather than aiming down their sights. There's a cumbersome unpredictability whenever the sight is used, which creates a discrepancy between where you were targeting from the hip and where you may then be targeting from the sight. It behaves like recoil that occurs before you've even fired a shot. This slows down gunplay as it means constantly re-lining up shots whenever you choose to aim in the first place, and though that should at least mean the shotguns of the world are fine since they hardly require aiming, they always felt underpowered.

On paper, combining an IP as narratively rich as Tron with a studio as driven by telling stories as Bithell should be a good match. And though Tron: Identity is a masterfully told tale, even with the branching possibilities it presents, the game ends so abruptly that it puts a dampener on the experience. Tron: Identity follows Query, a detective tasked with solving a case involving an explosion at The Repository, a massive building in the center of The Grid. Something valuable has been stolen from the Vault where the explosion occurred, and Query must investigate by speaking with those in charge of The Repository, asking questions to gain information, and solving puzzles to unlock memories stored in the series' iconic Identity Discs. From the jump, it's clear this choose-your-own-adventure style of visual novel is right in Bithell Games' wheelhouse. The first choice you're given seems innocuous, but it will affect how some people speak with you later down the line. Some characters switch from friendly to hostile depending on what you say, while others can go in the opposite direction. There were multiple moments early on where what I thought was the right decision blew up in my face, which kept me on my toes for the rest of the game. Every choice you make holds some weight and discovering the different paths through multiple playthroughs leads to some surprising new information. Replaying the game for all the info isn't a huge time commitment, as the full Tron: Identity story can be completed in less time than it takes to watch any of the Tron movies. My first time through the game, beginning with the title sequence and ending with the credits, took about 90 minutes. That includes solving all of the puzzles, having every possible conversation, and always choosing options that offer extra information. It's not a Tron movie so much as it's a long Disney+ episode of a nonexistent Tron series, and while it's a very strong episode with lots of twists and an intriguing cliffhanger, the run time leaves a lot to be desired. It's not that the brevity of the game is in itself bad--shorter games are definitely welcome in the age of vast open-world sandboxes we're currently living in--it's more about wanting to explore more of this new slice of Tron lore, and also about learning more about these particular characters. Going back to the \"long Disney+ episode\" analogy, reaching the end of this story felt like getting to the end of an episode of one of Telltale Games's stories, but with one key difference--I knew Telltale's games were episodic, so cliffhangers before the credits weren't as jarring. I had no such knowledge going into this game, and while Bithell has announced sequels since I've finished the story, technically I still don't know if they'll be direct follow-ups of Query's adventure here. Without knowing for sure, though, this game just leaves me hanging. The majority of that gameplay is spent in conversation with one of the handful of NPCs throughout the Repository, which offer multiple dialogue options that affect not only the actions of the plot, but the attitudes of those involved. Some runs will be a bloodbath. On that first run through, I discovered at least four of the six NPCs I encountered can be derezzed--Tron-speak for \"killed\"--depending on the choices I made. Make certain choices, however, and there are runs where no one will die at all. The unpredictable nature of the story, even in the second or third time through, is one of Tron: Identity's major strengths, as I never could guess what was coming in the next scene. A few times during the game, Query is asked to perform a task involving the Identity Discs of other characters. This task is represented in puzzle form, with multiple nodes of varying colors and numbers appearing on-screen. The goal is to eliminate nodes, one by one, until a target number of nodes remains, and you do that by choosing a node and matching it--either by number or colored symbol--to another one either right next to it or exactly three spaces away, which makes the one you're not holding disappear. These puzzles, which are fun little brain teasers, unfortunately do very little to advance the plot or my enjoyment of the game. Most of the time, they surface while I'm fully engaged in a scene, after which I'm then required to match symbols and numbers until the puzzle goes away and I can get back into the storytelling. Fortunately, the game allows you to skip any puzzle--which, in runs after the first, is a very welcome option. The game does include an Endless mode of just puzzles as well, so if I'm ever in a brain-teaser mood, I can fire this up and snuff out nodes to my heart's content. The in-game Codex also offers lore hunters a neat treasure hunt, as small pulsing nodes appear in multiple scenes throughout the game. Activating one unlocks a Codex entry, which further expands on how Tron: Identity fits into the larger Tron lore and the role that the game's characters have within it. One of the entries is written entirely in hexadecimal numbering, just to spice things up even further. However, there's one major issue I have with the Codex: For each of the game's NPCs, there is a chart with all of the different branches your relationship with that character can take. However, the screen only shows me the results of my most recent run. If the non-character entries of the Codex can carry over through multiple runs, why can't the branches of each character's story do the same once I've seen the corresponding scene? The completionist portion of my brain would have liked to see all of those question marks become worded entries, but alas it is not to be. Gallery Tron: Identity is a sharply written story that offers not only a fresh look at Tron, but also an interesting visual novel/puzzle hybrid format. The pacing of the story, the agency I feel when making choices, and the immediate weight of those choices make this a fine new addition to the visual novel library--even if the puzzles routinely pull me out of the story for a moment. I just wish there were more story told here, as my initial disappointment when finishing the game came not from what I'd played, but that the game was over so quickly. Ultimately, that's the mark of a well-made game, but I hope we get to learn more about this new Tron game's identity in the near future.","length":6514,"tokens":1380,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Tron: Identity Review - Gone In 60 Millicycles","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/","post_date":"April 14, 2023 at 9:46AM PDT","content":"Bithell Games finds itself with its highest-profile project to date in Tron: Identity, a visual novel set in Disney's sci-fi universe.

The game does include an Endless mode of just puzzles as well, so if I'm ever in a brain-teaser mood, I can fire this up and snuff out nodes to my heart's content.","content_length":889,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Tron: Identity Review - Gone In 60 Millicycles","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/","post_date":"April 14, 2023 at 9:46AM PDT","content":"The in-game Codex also offers lore hunters a neat treasure hunt, as small pulsing nodes appear in multiple scenes throughout the game. Activating one unlocks a Codex entry, which further expands on how Tron: Identity fits into the larger Tron lore and the role that the game's characters have within it. One of the entries is written entirely in hexadecimal numbering, just to spice things up even further. However, there's one major issue I have with the Codex: For each of the game's NPCs, there is a chart with all of the different branches your relationship with that character can take. However, the screen only shows me the results of my most recent run.","content_length":660,"content_tokens":139,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Tron: Identity Review - Gone In 60 Millicycles","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/","post_date":"April 14, 2023 at 9:46AM PDT","content":"If the non-character entries of the Codex can carry over through multiple runs, why can't the branches of each character's story do the same once I've seen the corresponding scene? The completionist portion of my brain would have liked to see all of those question marks become worded entries, but alas it is not to be. Gallery Tron: Identity is a sharply written story that offers not only a fresh look at Tron, but also an interesting visual novel/puzzle hybrid format. The pacing of the story, the agency I feel when making choices, and the immediate weight of those choices make this a fine new addition to the visual novel library--even if the puzzles routinely pull me out of the story for a moment. I just wish there were more story told here, as my initial disappointment when finishing the game came not from what I'd played, but that the game was over so quickly. Ultimately, that's the mark of a well-made game, but I hope we get to learn more about this new Tron game's identity in the near future.","content_length":1009,"content_tokens":217,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"EA Sports PGA Tour Review - Hit The Links","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-pga-tour-review-hit-the-links/1900-6418053/","date":"April 12, 2023 at 10:55AM PDT","content":"EA Sports PGA Tour is unlike any other golf game I've played. It still features familiar elements from the series' past--back when Tiger Woods was front and center--such as slow-motion heartbeat moments and climactic power shots. But after an eight-year hiatus from the world of golf simulation, EA has returned to the fairway with a more demanding recreation of the sport that's as much about feel as it is mastering the game's robust mechanics. With 30 courses covering all four majors--including The Masters at Augusta National--EA Sports PGA Tour has a plethora of golfing action to sink your teeth into. It's just a shame there are a few notable issues in critical areas that hold it back from greatness. The first of these is the game's swing mechanic. If you've played a golf game before, the actual act of swinging a driver or 5-iron will be familiar. You pull down on the analog stick to bring the club back, then push forward again to unleash your shot. This has been a staple in golf games for a number of years now, and there aren't any alternatives at the moment--not until a three-click system is implemented in a later update. The issue with EA Sports PGA Tour is that there's a slight delay between your input and the on-screen visual. Your swing isn't 1:1, so there's an uneasy disconnect where you never quite feel like you're in total control. The general malaise of each swing doesn't help matters either, with the slow, clunky pacing and frustrating lag making it difficult to nail the timing and power of each shot. I eventually grew accustomed to these idiosyncrasies over time, but it never feels quite right and fails to capture the satisfaction that hitting a 300-yard tee shot should achieve. To compound the issue, EA Sports PGA Tour also lacks any sort of meaningful tutorial. There are tooltips that pop up and cover the basics the first time you play, but these brief snippets barely scratch the surface of everything going on under the hood. Instead, the game has a suite of challenges that happen to include a Coaching Academy. This is the best place to start, even if these challenges still neglect to offer any tips or feedback to help you along the way. What you get is a variety of contextual situations covering different aspects of the sport, from putting downhill to dealing with elevation changes and the multitude of shot types on offer. There's a lot of trial and error involved, but the repetition of replaying each situation does give you a greater understanding of how everything works. It's not a very user-friendly approach, but it sets expectations and is genuinely helpful in an unconventional way, even if it might prove frustrating for some. Plus, completing these challenges also earns you XP that can be used to improve your created character. EA Sports PGA TourGallery EA Sports PGA Tour's career mode sits front and center, starting off with your no-name golfer competing in the qualifying school before moving on to the amateur Korn Ferry Tour. The ultimate goal is to reach the PGA Tour, which can be done either by winning one of the many four-round courses or by placing highly enough in the Korn Ferry rankings come season's end. You can expedite this process by opting for a quick play mode where you only need to play a few holes rather than an entire round, but I think playing full rounds is the way to go. That's mostly because it gives you ample time to fine-tune your skills, learn the courses, and gain a better understanding of the game's mechanics. There's also a palpable sense of progression that comes from leveling up your golfer. Earning XP lets you build your skills in driving, approach play, short game, and putting, while progressing each attribute also unlocks more shot types, giving you additional options when preparing to send the ball careening toward the green. Fortunately, the Coaching Academy includes challenges for each of the game's myriad shot types, giving you the opportunity to see how each one functions before playing competitively. There's value in understanding the differences between a runner, spinner, or knock-down shot, but knowing when to utilize each one essentially comes down to a matter of feel. In this respect, EA Sports PGA Tour resembles the sport of golf more accurately than any other game. There are a number of variables at play for every single shot, to the point where there's a real thought process behind each swing. You have to choose the right shot type and club for each situation, adjust for wind and elevation, judge how much power you need to put into the swing, and account for the distinct ways each course plays--tweaking your shot shape depending on the shape of the fairway and lie of the bunkers. The game helps to some degree by displaying relevant information such as wind speed and distance, but then you're left to your own devices. This can be frustrating, particularly early on when you're still learning the ropes and your golfer's attributes aren't up to snuff, but once everything clicks, EA Sports PGA Tour plays an engrossing game of golf that can be incredibly rewarding. Much of this is down to the courses themselves. Every single one of the 30 officially licensed courses is staggeringly beautiful and offers an authentic attention to detail, whether it's Liberty National and its view of the Manhattan skyline, the waves crashing against the sand at Pebble Beach, or the alligators lurking in the water at TPC Sawgrass. Almost every course is iconic on some level, and they've all been faithfully rendered and recreated, right down to individual blades of grass. The absence of a course designer is a tad disappointing, but unlike PGA Tour 2K23, it's not something that feels like a necessity because there are already so many 18-hole delights. The courses are the game's main character, providing the kind of variety and depth to stave off any tedium. Mastering a golf game's mechanics is usually the key to success, but EA Sports PGA Tour's courses demand much more from you. Each one plays differently, whether it's the roll of the green or the width of the fairway impacting your decision-making. It genuinely feels like you're playing against the course rather than the shot meter. EA Sports PGA TourGallery The physics model, which is built around the official TrackMan data for ball tracking and swing analysis, is excellent for the most part. However, there are some inconsistencies when it comes to ball rollout. On The Old Course at St Andrews, for instance, the rollout is overly extreme to the point where the ball will roll uphill at pace, even through heavy rough. This forces you to account for situations that shouldn't really occur. Once you land on the green, putting is also equally aggravating for different reasons. Each green contains a grid that uses moving beads to show you the direction of the break. The problem is that sometimes this data is inaccurate and the break is opposite to what the beads are showing. The putt reader alleviates this somewhat by showing the ideal path to the hole, but this is also misleading at times. With no reliable way to gauge the breaks, putting is a lesson in irritation that will only be rectified if these issues are fixed in future updates. Outside of career mode, EA Sports PGA Tour also features various tournament options for use in online matches against the community. If you want to play against friends, however, stroke play is the only option, and there's a disappointing lack of alternating play for those who want to see each other tee off. A range of daily, weekly, and seasonal tournaments give you another chance to earn XP and items like club specs and in-game cash for a limited time before they're refreshed, so there's an incentive to keep coming back. That in-game cash can be spent in a store of rotating items including various cosmetics, which holds some appeal because the character creator is extremely barebones. Outfitting your golfer in branded clothing can be fairly costly, though, which is explained by the inclusion of microtransactions for those who would rather buy the in-game currency with real money. This isn't a surprising move, but it doesn't exactly vibe with the serene mood. After almost a decade away from the sport, EA's return to the golf course is a promising one. The range of shot types, courses, and tangible variables make for a methodical and tactical game of golf that's both challenging and rewarding. It stumbles by barely introducing players to its robust mechanics, while a laggy swing and inconsistent putting are notable flaws on what is otherwise a fantastic golf sim.

However, as we get older and life grows more complex, so do the types of stories we yearn for. Although the hero's journey may serve as a foundation for countless tales, these stories ultimately evolve into retellings, reimaginings, subversions, and entirely new creations--ones that alter our notions as to what a story can be. It is this feeling of surprise and delight that Storyteller aims to capture. However, the imaginative puzzle game ultimately fails to bottle that magic, failing to meaningfully evolve and instead delivering a repetitive and underwhelming experience. The premise of Storyteller is simple yet tantalizing: You create stories that yield a certain outcome by altering the order in which key events occur. You do this by filling in boxes that resemble comic strip panels, using an established list of characters and settings to do so. As you structure your story, adjusting variables where needed in order to create the ending needed to pass the level, the panels interact with each other, resulting in a sort of interactive butterfly effect. A man slays a vampire to protect his bride. The challenges start off simple enough--make the prince and princess fall in love, help the knight slay the monster, etc.--then quickly become a bit more complex, requiring you to understand a certain character's temperament and how that may flavor their interactions with others. For example, the noble knight is wary of murdering another character. The bloodthirsty baron, on the other hand, will leap at the opportunity. Similarly, the knight will always vie for the queen's affection, though it remains up to you to get her to feel the same towards him. Simplicity is the heart of Storyteller--for better and for worse. The game's mechanics are easy to understand and make for a breezy experience, and its muted, cartoony-yet-minimalistic artwork is charming. Its simplicity also makes for an experience that suits portable consoles well, as it's easy to pick up and play a few puzzles while on the go. But while its premise is inspired, Storyteller suffers from feeling overly simple. At nearly 30 minutes into the game's hour-long runtime, it already begins to feel empty and far too small--too small for creativity, too small to provide a sense of challenge, and too small to create an engaging experience. You quickly discover there are very few variables and characters you can interact with, and they are frequently repeated throughout levels. This means once you're halfway through the game, you'll have no new puzzle pieces to ponder over or to attempt to squeeze into their proper place. And, once you have a grasp on how these variables interact with each other, each level feels less like a puzzle and more like a quick exercise of tossing things into place in order to move forward. At times, the game begins to feel downright tedious, as you are no longer solving puzzles but merely arranging very obvious sequences of events. One puzzle, for example, tasked me with establishing several different characters as related by having them say, \"I am your parent\" to other characters. There was no challenge to it, just the frustration of having to create several panels with the same sentence spoken by different characters to establish this lineage and some affection for each other. Regardless, and with the exception of one level that took me slightly longer than usual to figure out, I was able to absent-mindedly breeze through the entire experience, which fails to provide the sense of satisfaction you want from a puzzle game. The game presents itself as a book, with each chapter containing five levels with a similar theme. Even the handful of optional objectives scattered throughout its levels don't add much complexity to the game, as they often task you with just tweaking a couple things to get a slightly different result. These challenges often included things like completing a story in a certain number of frames or without using a particular character, yet are so simple you can generally knock them out the first time you solve the puzzle. Sure, it was cute enough to see some of these differences play out, but it also made me wish the game offered more room for creativity--a larger bank of variables to play around with and more options on how to reach a level's end goal. Storyteller is frustrating in that it never feels as if you are truly solving a puzzle or creating a story of your own. Rather, you are trying to piece together the exact story the game expects from you. While there are a few levels where you can attain a satisfactory ending multiple ways, these feel few and far between. Ultimately, all these issues stifle the experience, reducing it to a creative concept that doesn't feel fulfilled. This also eliminates any replayability the game might have, as once you play a level, there's no benefit to trying to find a different solution and achieve a new outcome. As someone who loves fairy tales and has sunk quite a few hours into creative puzzle games like Scribblenauts, I was delighted by the prospect of playing Storyteller. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. While its concept is interesting, the game ultimately feels confined--held back by simple puzzles and its lack of creative freedom.","length":5451,"tokens":1080,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Storyteller Review - Tale As Old As Time","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/storyteller-review-tale-as-old-as-time/1900-6418052/","post_date":"April 5, 2023 at 9:36AM PDT","content":"For many of us, the fantastic tales of knights and dragons, love and loss, and brave heroes overcoming all obstacles are the ones that made us fall in love with storytelling.

The game presents itself as a book, with each chapter containing five levels with a similar theme.","content_length":1044,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Storyteller Review - Tale As Old As Time","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/storyteller-review-tale-as-old-as-time/1900-6418052/","post_date":"April 5, 2023 at 9:36AM PDT","content":"Even the handful of optional objectives scattered throughout its levels don't add much complexity to the game, as they often task you with just tweaking a couple things to get a slightly different result. These challenges often included things like completing a story in a certain number of frames or without using a particular character, yet are so simple you can generally knock them out the first time you solve the puzzle. Sure, it was cute enough to see some of these differences play out, but it also made me wish the game offered more room for creativity--a larger bank of variables to play around with and more options on how to reach a level's end goal. Storyteller is frustrating in that it never feels as if you are truly solving a puzzle or creating a story of your own. Rather, you are trying to piece together the exact story the game expects from you.

Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming.

Joel looks different in The Last of Us Part I. It took me a while to notice, but once I did, it was hard to unsee. There's a pain in his eyes. His clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. I've played The Last of Us nearly a dozen times across PS3 and PS4, and I had never seen it worn so plainly. I know Joel has a troubled past because The Last of Us Part I goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5. But The Last of Us Part I is more than the sum of its parts. It's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago. The most obvious way The Last of Us Part I does this is with its visuals. The overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make The Last of Us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. I can feel the repressed pain in Joel, sense the pervasive hope in Marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in Ellie. These details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. Admittedly, these are also details that I've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. But the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. The writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas. What does recontextualize the characters is the existence of The Last of Us Part II. Joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and Ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in Part I all the more tragic. Even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in Part II, it makes the final moments of The Last of Us Part I tougher to swallow. What's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, I rarely questioned Joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. It's a testament to Naughty Dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what Joel's actions entailed--I wanted to protect Ellie at all costs. All those complicated feelings The Last of Us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when I wrapped up Part I. The gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. Aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and Joel is a bit easier to maneuver. He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history. The improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. Every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. The unpredictable AI makes for some harrowing firefights. Success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill. What really makes the AI so effective is its tenacity. Enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. They feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart. It helps that companion AI is much better, too. In the original, Ellie, Tess, and Bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. They couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see Ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic. Where The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. It was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. Naughty Dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. They are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn’t need them. The Last of Us Part I is an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years agoThe combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. This lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. It's a shame because Joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use. It's even harder to overlook given how impressive Part II's level design was. The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this \"remake\" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games. The biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone. It may have seemed like a minor mechanic in The Last of Us Part II, but it fundamentally changed the way I approached combat. Obviously, Part I was not designed with a crawling Joel in mind. There is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between Part I and Part II. However, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes The Last of Us Part I's achievements. The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. The environments are rich with details that add flavor to Joel and Ellie's journey. The most welcome addition to The Last of Us Part I is its impressive suite of accessibility features. Like The Last of Us Part II, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. You can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one. Additionally, The Last of Us Part I adds a ton of new unlockables in the Extras menu. Like in previous Naughty Dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. There's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. While none of this fundamentally changes the experience, I spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package. The most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. Naughty Dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of The Last of Us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original Factions mode didn't make the cut. Gallery Those looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. The permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of The Last of Us. It's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I. All these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever. The Last of Us Part I For PCHot off the heels of the successful The Last of Us on HBO, the long-awaited port of the first game in Naughty Dog's acclaimed series has arrived on PC with disappointing results. Those who have waited over a decade since the game's original release on PS3, or anyone looking to replay the first chapter in Joel and Ellie's tale again on PC, will be let down by the game's overall performance, which manages to shine only on the most expensive and least used hardware on the market today. There are two fundamental issues that plague The Last of Us Part I on PC. First is VRAM (video memory found on your GPU) usage, and more specifically how much the game demands. Running at 1440p with Ultra settings, the game's expansive settings menu informed me that the 12GB of VRAM on my RTX 3080 Ti would not be enough, suggesting I drop settings like texture quality and filtering down to compensate. Ignoring the advice led to some consistent stuttering during gameplay, which, for a change, isn't down to shader compilation stutter. After first opening the game, you're subjected to a 45-minute-long shader compilation (which you'll have to do again after a graphics driver update or reinstallation), negatively impacting performance if you decide to play while this happens. But once that's complete, it meant that any stutters I did encounter were exclusively due to settings pushing past the recommended VRAM limits. That means, for a relatively powerful GPU like the RTX 3080 Ti, Ultra settings even at 1440p were off the table, which doesn't bode well for cards lower down the chain. The RTX 3070, a popular choice amongst PC gamers, only comes with 8GB of VRAM, which prevents you from playing The Last of Us Part I with anything higher than Medium texture settings, irrespective of resolution. I verified this using an RTX 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM, which doesn't perform equally to the RTX 3070 but has the exact same memory limitations. What's problematic about that is just how drastically different the game looks at these settings, with texture resolution and clarity taking a significant hit between High and Medium presets. It's so degraded that it's at a point where you're playing a far less visually impressive game when compared to its PlayStation 5 version, despite having more capable hardware. The second issue is CPU performance. The Last of Us Part I makes surprisingly great use of all the cores of your CPU, which isn't the norm in a sea of titles that are still so reliant on powerful single cores. What is baffling, and detrimental to performance, is just how much the game is using your CPU all the time, and how hard it is frequently each core in the least demanding scenarios. Near the opening hour of the game, I was standing in an empty alleyway with only two other NPCs in sight and zero interactions taking place. At this moment, The Last of Us Part I was hammering all 12 threads of my AMD Ryzen 5600X, with each one reporting over 80% usage. While moving around and engaging in combat, each thread was routinely hovering around 90-95% usage, touching 100% from time to time and limiting my overall frame rate as a result. Marvel's Spider-Man on PC is another CPU-heavy game, but in that situation it makes more sense, as you're moving fast through a large open world with loads more happening as you zip past traffic and pedestrians. And even then, I never saw CPU usage at half of what The Last of Us Part I was demanding during my time with Spider-Man. The Last of Us Part I's CPU usage is currently out of control, and you'll probably find yourself CPU-limited in numerous scenarios even if you have the latest GPU to push past its other issues. It's a shame that playing The Last of Us Part I right now on anything but a GPU with at least (and preferably more than) 12GB of VRAM is a severely limited experience--especially when compared to its stellar performance on Sony's own hardware--because this remake routinely establishes itself as one of the most visually captivating ports of a Sony title yet on PC. It's difficult to reconcile that this was once a game on two-generations-old console hardware, but if you have the graphical horsepower to show it off at its best, it's a marvel of gorgeous lighting, highly-detailed environments, and stunnings character modeling that is accentuated with additional PC settings that show the game off in a new, stunning light. The settings menu itself is extensive, with helpful previews that show how your changes are affecting the image and useful descriptions informing you of what parts of your PC you're helping by turning things down. The VRAM usage meter is helpful in reigning in settings that would otherwise cause irritating stutter, but it's also the facet of this menu that's most confusing. It features a section that suggests a portion of your VRAM is being locked up by other applications and your operating system, but the figure it reports doesn't correlate to actual usage. Even more confusing is that this figure scales according to how much VRAM you have in total, with 2.4GB being used on my 12GB RTX 3080 Ti and 1.5GB on my RTX 3050. There is no real way to bring it down, either, which may (or may not) be affecting overall VRAM usage by the game itself. This is something that should hopefully be addressed by future patches, along with a host of other performance improvements and optimizations to bring this port to a level of quality we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. It's disappointing after the relatively good work done on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection that The Last of Us Part I seems a long way away from being a smooth experience for most players. So if you've been waiting all these years to finally experience Joel and Ellie's story for the first time, it's probably best if you wait at least a little longer.","length":19896,"tokens":4314,"chunks":[{"post_title":"The Last Of Us Part I PS5 And PC Review - Desolation Row","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-and-pc-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/","post_date":"April 5, 2023 at 3:27AM PDT","content":"The Last of Us Part I's PS5 version was reviewed by Jake Dekker, while its PC port was reviewed by Alessandro Barbosa.

He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out.","content_length":913,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Of Us Part I PS5 And PC Review - Desolation Row","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-and-pc-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/","post_date":"April 5, 2023 at 3:27AM PDT","content":"This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history. The improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics.","content_length":918,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"The Last Of Us Part I PS5 And PC Review - Desolation Row","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-and-pc-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/","post_date":"April 5, 2023 at 3:27AM PDT","content":"Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention.

If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome.

Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic. Where The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water.

Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years agoThe combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover.

The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this \"remake\" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games. The biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone.

The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago.

Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one.

These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package. The most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat.

Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I.

The Last of Us Part I For PCHot off the heels of the successful The Last of Us on HBO, the long-awaited port of the first game in Naughty Dog's acclaimed series has arrived on PC with disappointing results. Those who have waited over a decade since the game's original release on PS3, or anyone looking to replay the first chapter in Joel and Ellie's tale again on PC, will be let down by the game's overall performance, which manages to shine only on the most expensive and least used hardware on the market today.

Ignoring the advice led to some consistent stuttering during gameplay, which, for a change, isn't down to shader compilation stutter. After first opening the game, you're subjected to a 45-minute-long shader compilation (which you'll have to do again after a graphics driver update or reinstallation), negatively impacting performance if you decide to play while this happens.

I verified this using an RTX 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM, which doesn't perform equally to the RTX 3070 but has the exact same memory limitations. What's problematic about that is just how drastically different the game looks at these settings, with texture resolution and clarity taking a significant hit between High and Medium presets. It's so degraded that it's at a point where you're playing a far less visually impressive game when compared to its PlayStation 5 version, despite having more capable hardware.

The legendary number 42 made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut in 1947 and lit up the diamond with his electric playstyle, all while facing intolerance and hatred from fans, opposing players, and teammates alike. Jackie Robinson's alluring talent was one of the reasons he was chosen to be the first Negro League player to integrate into the previously segregated Major Leagues, but it was his outstanding intangibles--such as his ability to handle racist abuse with grace--that sealed the deal. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, will tell you that Jackie Robinson wasn't the greatest player to ply his trade in the Negro Leagues. That's not to disparage one of the greatest players of all time, but to provide context for just how good some of the league's other players were. MLB The Show 23 shines a spotlight on these unknown and forgotten heroes of the Negro Leagues. A new Storylines mode explores the league's rich history, telling a captivating story of extraordinary people triumphing in the face of abhorrent prejudice and hate. It's a landmark moment for sports games--and video games in general--meshing The Show's consistently excellent gameplay with educational and inspiring video packages narrated by the extremely knowledgeable Kendrick himself. The rest of the game iterates on its predecessors and shakes up the Diamond Dynasty formula with some major changes, but it's Storylines: The Negro Leagues that stands out above all else and elevates the entire experience. Eight players are featured in this interactive learning tool: Leroy \"Satchel\" Page, Hilton Smith, Andrew \"Rube\" Foster, Hank Thompson, John Jordan \"Buck\" O'Neil, Jackie Robinson, John Donaldson, and Martin Dihigo. You may have only heard of one or two of these players, but every legendary figure has a whole series dedicated to their life and career, with each one spanning between eight and nine episodes. MLB The Show 23Gallery A single episode consists of a video package combining archival footage with eye-catching art that brings each player to life, and one or two gameplay scenarios that highlight what made them so special. These are similar to the Moments found in Diamond Dynasty, tasking you with completing different objectives such as striking out two batters or hitting a home run. They're usually fairly short, but the commentary adds additional trinkets about the players and the circumstances surrounding each moment, and the attention to detail in each one is fantastic. All of the authentic team uniforms and stadiums are featured, right down to the baggy pants and era-appropriate vehicles sitting in the parking lot. Even the crowds are dolled up, with men sporting ties and women wearing their finest dresses. The best teams often played each other on Sunday afternoons, so the capacity crowds would show up after church dressed in their Sunday best. These weren't just ballgames, but social occasions, and a venue for African-Americans to express themselves. It's great that this is reflected in the game. However, the moments that stand out the most are those that implement details learned from Kendrick's fascinating narration. In your first game pitching with Satchel Page, for instance, his repertoire consists of the usual fastballs and sliders. Yet this changes after you find out he had unique names for every pitch type he threw. In subsequent games, you choose to pitch from a selection including a bee, dipsy, and creep. It's a small detail, but one of the ways Storylines showcases Satchel's enormous personality. The best of these is when he makes a point of striking out the side after a white opposing player insults him with a racial epithet. The kicker is that he does so after instructing the entire defense to huddle around the mound; such was his confidence that the hitters wouldn't be able to make contact with his electrifying stuff. Baseball is a sport full of history and mythology, and you can see how Kendrick relishes in recounting the myths surrounding these players while also delving into the facts. His stories are as much about baseball as they are about civil rights, and the way he tells them is both captivating and highly illuminating. This might be the first time you'll hear about Negro League teams having to take grueling 24-hour bus rides to away games, not knowing if they'd be able to find a place to eat or a hotel to stay in because of their skin color. In the modern game, Shohei Ohtani is rightfully lauded for being an All-Star at the plate and on the mound, with many proclaiming that such a feat hasn't occurred since Babe Ruth graced the diamond, yet the Negro Leagues were full of exceptional two-way stars--including Martin Dihigo, who was not only a pitcher but also played every single position on the field. Storylines: The Negro Leagues draws attention to players who were lionized by their communities because of their ability to excel and overcome the limits imposed on them by systemic racism. These eight Black baseball pioneers are some of the best the sport has ever known, yet knowing who they are is a rarity for so many. The Show 23 is hopefully a marker for change, because the Negro Leagues are an integral part of both baseball and American history, and the people involved deserve to have their stories told. You can even match them up against modern stars, as completing each player's series unlocks a 90-rated version of them for use in Diamond Dynasty. The long-running card-collecting mode remains one of the best iterations of its type. Microtransactions are still present, but Sony San Diego continues to move further away from this gross practice cementing itself at Diamond Dynasty's core. There are dozens of ways to collect and build a team of your favorite players just by playing the game, whether they're legends from the past or current superstars--from mini-seasons and showdowns to conquest maps and online ranked matches. MLB The Show 23Gallery The big change this year is a shift to seasonal teams, which breaks the traditional power curve by introducing 99-rated cards right out of the gate. Throughout the year, seasons will cycle out cards to ensure that squads are kept fresh. For instance, you can currently earn World Baseball Classic-themed cards, but once Season 3 starts on July 7, these players won't be available to use in modes like Conquest and ranked matches. Instead, there will be new cards to unlock and use, ensuring that you won't end up facing the same two pitchers throughout the game's lifespan, as was the case last year. It's a divisive change, but one that will make for more diverse teams while also letting you earn powerful cards much earlier than before. The addition of team captains also makes it viable to build theme teams, as new Captain cards will boost particular players. If you set someone like newly added legend Derek Jeter as captain and put him on a team with other Captain Series hitters, they'll all receive boosts to various attributes. Currently, this ties into mini-seasons, where you can compete with theme teams to earn specific rewards. One requires you to build a squad like the one mentioned above, while the other challenges you to construct a team comprised of nothing but lefties. This incentivizes you to use players you might not otherwise consider and should keep mini-seasons feeling fresh throughout the year. Once you step up to the plate or settle in on the mound, The Show 23 still plays a fantastic game of baseball. Tweaks to the Button Accuracy throwing meter create a greater disparity between good and great fielders, while also factoring in the difficulty of each throw. Previously, the meter was consistent, with the accurate green zone always appearing in the middle. This made it easy to hurl pinpoint throws each time, but now the green zone will dynamically move and shrink to account for tough infield plays and long outfield throws. Fielding is more engaging as a result, and this adds to the game's authenticity as you'll definitely see more throwing errors this time around. The outfield also feels somewhat bigger. This is taken from a small sample size, but so far, doubles are much more prevalent than home runs in The Show 23. The long ball was perhaps too frequent last year, but now the pendulum seems to have swung the opposite way. This isn't a bad thing, although Moments that task you with hitting bombs can drag when fly balls continuously die at the warning track. Franchise mode is much the same as before, aside from the addition of an overhauled scouting system. Each week before the draft, you're able to assign three scouts to scout a specific prospect, a single position, or unearth players who aren't even on your draft board yet. Prospect generation is much improved this year. Previously, draft classes included far too many older players, but each draft now contains players in the range of 18 to 23 years old, with most of them erring on the younger side. Scouting a player gives you a rough estimate of their attributes and potential, but you won't know a player's true rating until after you draft and sign them. This mimics reality to some degree since very few prospects are a sure thing. You could draft the next great superstar or end up with a player who never even steps foot in the majors. The MLB draft slot and signing bonus system have also been added to the game, so even after you've drafted a player you still need to sign them to a deal before the deadline passes, forcing you to consider their interest level and potential signing bonus amount before drafting them. All of this makes the draft a much more exciting proposition, although the same can't be said for Road to the Show, which adds little more than a few new presentational flourishes. After feeling like the series was treading water for the past couple of years, MLB The Show 23 sees Sony San Diego introduce some significant additions to its baseball sim. Road to the Show has still been neglected, but incremental gameplay improvements slightly enhance the on-field action, and Franchise has received a long-overdue shot in the arm with its expanded scouting system. The new seasonal structure to Diamond Dynasty should also make for a more interesting mode throughout the course of the year, and Storylines: The Negro Leagues is worth the price of admission alone. It may not move the needle in every area, but MLB The Show 23 is another deep sports title that will keep you busy long into October and beyond.","length":10734,"tokens":2160,"chunks":[{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"Jackie Robinson is many things: a hall of fame baseball player; a Rookie of the Year, MVP, and World Series winner; and, most notably, the first Black man to break baseball's color line and compete in the Major Leagues.

It's a landmark moment for sports games--and video games in general--meshing The Show's consistently excellent gameplay with educational and inspiring video packages narrated by the extremely knowledgeable Kendrick himself. The rest of the game iterates on its predecessors and shakes up the Diamond Dynasty formula with some major changes, but it's Storylines: The Negro Leagues that stands out above all else and elevates the entire experience.","content_length":854,"content_tokens":166,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"Eight players are featured in this interactive learning tool: Leroy \"Satchel\" Page, Hilton Smith, Andrew \"Rube\" Foster, Hank Thompson, John Jordan \"Buck\" O'Neil, Jackie Robinson, John Donaldson, and Martin Dihigo. You may have only heard of one or two of these players, but every legendary figure has a whole series dedicated to their life and career, with each one spanning between eight and nine episodes. MLB The Show 23Gallery A single episode consists of a video package combining archival footage with eye-catching art that brings each player to life, and one or two gameplay scenarios that highlight what made them so special. These are similar to the Moments found in Diamond Dynasty, tasking you with completing different objectives such as striking out two batters or hitting a home run. They're usually fairly short, but the commentary adds additional trinkets about the players and the circumstances surrounding each moment, and the attention to detail in each one is fantastic.","content_length":990,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"All of the authentic team uniforms and stadiums are featured, right down to the baggy pants and era-appropriate vehicles sitting in the parking lot. Even the crowds are dolled up, with men sporting ties and women wearing their finest dresses. The best teams often played each other on Sunday afternoons, so the capacity crowds would show up after church dressed in their Sunday best. These weren't just ballgames, but social occasions, and a venue for African-Americans to express themselves. It's great that this is reflected in the game. However, the moments that stand out the most are those that implement details learned from Kendrick's fascinating narration. In your first game pitching with Satchel Page, for instance, his repertoire consists of the usual fastballs and sliders. Yet this changes after you find out he had unique names for every pitch type he threw. In subsequent games, you choose to pitch from a selection including a bee, dipsy, and creep.","content_length":965,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"It's a small detail, but one of the ways Storylines showcases Satchel's enormous personality. The best of these is when he makes a point of striking out the side after a white opposing player insults him with a racial epithet. The kicker is that he does so after instructing the entire defense to huddle around the mound; such was his confidence that the hitters wouldn't be able to make contact with his electrifying stuff. Baseball is a sport full of history and mythology, and you can see how Kendrick relishes in recounting the myths surrounding these players while also delving into the facts. His stories are as much about baseball as they are about civil rights, and the way he tells them is both captivating and highly illuminating.","content_length":740,"content_tokens":150,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"This might be the first time you'll hear about Negro League teams having to take grueling 24-hour bus rides to away games, not knowing if they'd be able to find a place to eat or a hotel to stay in because of their skin color. In the modern game, Shohei Ohtani is rightfully lauded for being an All-Star at the plate and on the mound, with many proclaiming that such a feat hasn't occurred since Babe Ruth graced the diamond, yet the Negro Leagues were full of exceptional two-way stars--including Martin Dihigo, who was not only a pitcher but also played every single position on the field. Storylines: The Negro Leagues draws attention to players who were lionized by their communities because of their ability to excel and overcome the limits imposed on them by systemic racism. These eight Black baseball pioneers are some of the best the sport has ever known, yet knowing who they are is a rarity for so many.","content_length":914,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"The Show 23 is hopefully a marker for change, because the Negro Leagues are an integral part of both baseball and American history, and the people involved deserve to have their stories told. You can even match them up against modern stars, as completing each player's series unlocks a 90-rated version of them for use in Diamond Dynasty. The long-running card-collecting mode remains one of the best iterations of its type. Microtransactions are still present, but Sony San Diego continues to move further away from this gross practice cementing itself at Diamond Dynasty's core. There are dozens of ways to collect and build a team of your favorite players just by playing the game, whether they're legends from the past or current superstars--from mini-seasons and showdowns to conquest maps and online ranked matches.

For instance, you can currently earn World Baseball Classic-themed cards, but once Season 3 starts on July 7, these players won't be available to use in modes like Conquest and ranked matches. Instead, there will be new cards to unlock and use, ensuring that you won't end up facing the same two pitchers throughout the game's lifespan, as was the case last year. It's a divisive change, but one that will make for more diverse teams while also letting you earn powerful cards much earlier than before. The addition of team captains also makes it viable to build theme teams, as new Captain cards will boost particular players. If you set someone like newly added legend Derek Jeter as captain and put him on a team with other Captain Series hitters, they'll all receive boosts to various attributes. Currently, this ties into mini-seasons, where you can compete with theme teams to earn specific rewards.","content_length":993,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"One requires you to build a squad like the one mentioned above, while the other challenges you to construct a team comprised of nothing but lefties. This incentivizes you to use players you might not otherwise consider and should keep mini-seasons feeling fresh throughout the year. Once you step up to the plate or settle in on the mound, The Show 23 still plays a fantastic game of baseball. Tweaks to the Button Accuracy throwing meter create a greater disparity between good and great fielders, while also factoring in the difficulty of each throw. Previously, the meter was consistent, with the accurate green zone always appearing in the middle. This made it easy to hurl pinpoint throws each time, but now the green zone will dynamically move and shrink to account for tough infield plays and long outfield throws. Fielding is more engaging as a result, and this adds to the game's authenticity as you'll definitely see more throwing errors this time around. The outfield also feels somewhat bigger.","content_length":1006,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"This is taken from a small sample size, but so far, doubles are much more prevalent than home runs in The Show 23. The long ball was perhaps too frequent last year, but now the pendulum seems to have swung the opposite way. This isn't a bad thing, although Moments that task you with hitting bombs can drag when fly balls continuously die at the warning track. Franchise mode is much the same as before, aside from the addition of an overhauled scouting system. Each week before the draft, you're able to assign three scouts to scout a specific prospect, a single position, or unearth players who aren't even on your draft board yet. Prospect generation is much improved this year. Previously, draft classes included far too many older players, but each draft now contains players in the range of 18 to 23 years old, with most of them erring on the younger side.","content_length":862,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/","post_date":"April 3, 2023 at 6:43AM PDT","content":"Scouting a player gives you a rough estimate of their attributes and potential, but you won't know a player's true rating until after you draft and sign them. This mimics reality to some degree since very few prospects are a sure thing. You could draft the next great superstar or end up with a player who never even steps foot in the majors. The MLB draft slot and signing bonus system have also been added to the game, so even after you've drafted a player you still need to sign them to a deal before the deadline passes, forcing you to consider their interest level and potential signing bonus amount before drafting them. All of this makes the draft a much more exciting proposition, although the same can't be said for Road to the Show, which adds little more than a few new presentational flourishes.

It's a playful, yet often deadly game, where typically the one holding the rod is in full control. Out on the open seas, this dynamic is often flipped. Manning a trawler for days on end, fighting devastating weather conditions, and drifting away from land for weeks at a time can take a toll on your body and mind. It's these sorts of conditions that Dredge so neatly encapsulates in a handful of smartly designed mechanics, but it's the sinister undertone seeping through every crack that makes its fishing expeditions that much more treacherous. You begin Dredge arriving at a small fishing hamlet on an ever-so-slightly larger island. The town's mayor is in need of someone to supply its population with fish and loans you a small but capable boat to fulfill that. Fishing is what you'll do most in Dredge given that you'll never get the chance to set foot on land, so it's a blessing that it never feels tedious. Each battle with a creature beneath the crest of the waves plays out as a brief minigame focused on timed button presses. The format of each one changes depending on the class of fish you're trying to catch, but the basic premise and overall difficulty remains the same. Completing each one isn't even required for a successful catch. Instead, your ability in each minigame just speeds up the process, which can come in handy when you're trying to get back to shore before nightfall. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

A thick fog settles in over the wide expanse, with your boat's lights often struggling to cut through them effectively for navigation. While out at night, your stress levels rise consistently (indicated by a Sauron-like eye that starts moving more erratically the higher the level goes), and with it, the chance for some surreal occurrences. Rocks that you might have been sure weren't on your path before suddenly appear, damaging your hull and potentially robbing you of some of your current haul. As you press on through the stress, your so-called delusions intensify, with anything from pitch-black ravens with glowing red eyes beginning to circle you to ghostly ships appearing in your periphery and setting themselves on a crash course with your vessel. Dredge threads the needle of mystery by never explaining these events outright. Each time you dock after a long night out, citizens of the various islands you explore will comment on your tiredness and warn you of the dangers of sailing without sleep. Converse with them more and you'll likely find that everyone knows something strange is happening out on the water, but no one is willing to offer an explanation as to what. Small notes in bottles strewn across the open oceans suggest a past event that might explain the unexplainable occurrences you'll often witness, but even then, there's a delightful amount that's left for you to piece together. Dredge, with its eldritch horror inspirations, predictably doesn't give you a straightforward answer by the end, and also disappointingly saves its most grotesque imagery for the few seconds before credits roll. While its themes are pervasive enough throughout to give Dredge a distinctly Lovecraftian feel, there's no denying that its otherwise suitably vague ending would have been more impactful with a similar level of horror strewn throughout. It might seem easy enough to just confine all of your fishing to the day time to avoid any unsettling encounters and potential inventory loss, but Dredge's systems are balanced in a way that routinely provokes you to take a risk. Time, for example, doesn't pass when you're stationary, but will rapidly fly by as you move and partake in fishing. It was common for me to try squeezing in one more fishing spot before returning to the harbor, only for one or two mishaps during the timing in the minigame to plunge the world around me into darkness and make the journey back all the more treacherous. Many species of fish are also only available to catch at night, and given their requirement in some quests, you're often given no choice but to brave the fog in search of the right shapes beneath the surface to pluck up and deliver to needy townsfolk. It's also just captivating to see how far you can push your sanity in Dredge at times, admiring how the world around you is twisted underneath oppressive red hues after days without a wink of sleep. It's easy enough to want to explore the open waters that Dredge has to offer, but it's the adventure encapsulating its vague story that provides most of the impetus to visit its handful of distinct island clusters. You travel to each location in search of five innocuous objects for a shifty stranger, who bestows some mysterious powers upon you and your boat with each new delivery. One lets you add a boost to your boat's engines but elevates your stress level and risks full engine failure the more you use it. Another teleports you right back to the home of the stranger at the expense of even more sanity, although most of the time it was the most effective way of cutting out tedious backtracking. Those two, out of a possible four in total, were the most useful, and rarely seemed as exciting in practice as their sinister source suggested. While it was fun to rip an entire school of fish out of the water with the use of a power, it rarely became something that felt crucial in my repertoire of abilities, eventually fading from memory as I continued with regular fishing instead. It's a disappointing waste of a reward in this sense, making each required trip back to the stranger more menial than exciting. While the conclusion of each stage of your adventure isn't always mechanically rewarding, each of the quests you undertake makes the journey worth taking. It's thanks in no small part to the variety of locales you visit, from a maze of caverns with a craggy town sprawled across its mountains, to waters laden with torn-apart scientific equipment (due to a monstrous, tentacled creature from the abyss), to an abandoned civilization around a dormant volcano with just a few fanatics left to tell their tales. Dredge's world is layered with these engaging biomes to visit, peppered with a variety of different fish to discover and catch with a host of different fishing rods, reels, and traps. Despite resting on the same underlying mechanics for each, it finds inventive ways of making most of its fetch quests exciting, either through routinely shuffled objectives that challenge you to rethink your equipment and pursue upgrades, or how to effectively survey the waters around you for the right shapes to hunt down. Gallery The process of upgrading your ship is an engrossing one too, with a variety of items to unlock and enhancements to construct. Research points are used to unlock new items at merchants. Rods, reels, and trawling nets all have certain classifications, which determine where they can be used and what fish they can catch, and more expensive ones combine traits. This is important given that only a limited portion of your inventory can be assigned to equipment, with spaces for your boat's lights and engines being given their respective slots, too. Increasing your overall inventory space (which you have to manually rearrange like a small game of Tetris) is done by dredging parts from numerous other shipwrecks and using the parts to improve your vessel. Everything costs money, however, so while you're helping out townsfolk around each new hamlet, you'll need to be balancing that with a healthy supply of income from fishing to continually make progress. It's a satisfying loop that lets you catch a few fish in the early hours of a new day as a set off towards an objective, sometimes turning into full resource runs if you happen upon expensive catches or large deposits of resources that you don't want to risk on a journey back in the dark. The constant threat of the night and the engaging balance of risk and rewards is ultimately what makes each of the hours spent with Dredge so rewarding. The manifestations of your stressed psyche are intelligently represented by varying degrees of oddities at sea, which instill an appropriate sense of unease that is supported by the uneasiness of all the other characters you meet sprawled across each of the game's wonderfully varied islands. There are instances where its eldritch themes could've been expanded on more, especially when taking into account how the otherworldly powers you're bestowed are the least interesting part of your repertoire. But Dredge does a lot with many small, simple mechanics, all of which coalesce into a satisfying system that makes the horrors of this maritime adventure a thrill to tackle bow-on.","length":10760,"tokens":2344,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Dredge Review - Grant Us Eels","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dredge-review-grant-us-eels/1900-6418049/","post_date":"March 23, 2023 at 11:33AM PDT","content":"For many, fishing is a serene, relaxing hobby.

Dredge, with its eldritch horror inspirations, predictably doesn't give you a straightforward answer by the end, and also disappointingly saves its most grotesque imagery for the few seconds before credits roll.

It was common for me to try squeezing in one more fishing spot before returning to the harbor, only for one or two mishaps during the timing in the minigame to plunge the world around me into darkness and make the journey back all the more treacherous.

You travel to each location in search of five innocuous objects for a shifty stranger, who bestows some mysterious powers upon you and your boat with each new delivery. One lets you add a boost to your boat's engines but elevates your stress level and risks full engine failure the more you use it.

Dredge's world is layered with these engaging biomes to visit, peppered with a variety of different fish to discover and catch with a host of different fishing rods, reels, and traps.

This is important given that only a limited portion of your inventory can be assigned to equipment, with spaces for your boat's lights and engines being given their respective slots, too. Increasing your overall inventory space (which you have to manually rearrange like a small game of Tetris) is done by dredging parts from numerous other shipwrecks and using the parts to improve your vessel.

The manifestations of your stressed psyche are intelligently represented by varying degrees of oddities at sea, which instill an appropriate sense of unease that is supported by the uneasiness of all the other characters you meet sprawled across each of the game's wonderfully varied islands. There are instances where its eldritch themes could've been expanded on more, especially when taking into account how the otherworldly powers you're bestowed are the least interesting part of your repertoire.

No one expected him to lace up his boots and step back into the ring again, yet the Heartbreak Kid made a triumphant return in 2002, eventually going on to cement his legacy with unforgettable matches against the likes of Triple H, The Undertaker, and Ric Flair. The quality of the second half of Michaels' career ensured that his surprise comeback would be remembered as one of the most spectacular returns in WWE history, and it's one that's echoed in some ways by WWE 2K23. Following the disaster that was 2K20--a game so bad its successor was outright canceled--developer Visual Concepts returned to the squared circle last year with a solid foundation that 2K23 improves upon in a variety of ways, finally putting the long-running series back on form with a surprise comeback Mr. WrestleMania himself would be proud of. Little has changed since last year's entry from a gameplay perspective. You still alternate between light and heavy strikes to execute various combos; grapple your opponent to hit them with suplexes, DDTs, and spinning neck breakers; and build up meters to gain access to signature moves and flashy match-ending finishers. Some may bemoan that it still doesn't play like No Mercy--an N64 game that many still consider the best wrestling game ever--but the series has never tried to. 2K23 is a solid wrestling sim, with most matches swaying back and forth as momentum shifts via desperate reversals and last-ditch kick-outs. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The timing window on reversals, for instance, has been tightened up. Previously, it was a little too easy to turn the tide of a contest thanks to the generous amount of time you were given to nullify an attack. With a shorter window, reversals feel more impactful this year, encouraging you to study your opponent's move set and sharpen your reaction times as a result. This ensures matches are more engaging and also imbues each one with some added tension. The new pin-break mechanic, where you flick the right stick up to mimic a kick-out, also enhances the in-ring action. It's not a huge, game-changing addition, but nailing the timing of this simple mini-game becomes more challenging later on in matches when your energy is waning, and there's something about imitating the physicality of a wrestler erupting out of a pin that adds to the drama. You can still stick with button-mashing if you'd prefer, but flicking the right stick just makes more sense on a fundamental level. The other changes to 2K23's action aren't as immediately obvious, but it doesn't take too long to notice how each one has a positive impact. There's a stronger emphasis on stamina in this year's game, with wrestlers slowing down the longer a match lasts. You can perform in-ring springboard attacks as well, and tag teams will work together in the Royal Rumble instead of immediately trying to eliminate each other. The AI has also been tweaked so that each Superstar behaves closer to their real-life counterparts--which means you won't see a giant like Omos flying off the top turnbuckle. You can even access sliders to edit these tendencies yourself--Fire Pro Wrestling style--so those who enjoy running AI vs. AI match-ups should be able to create matches that aren't too far removed from what we see on an episode of Smackdown each week. The AI, in general, is much improved from last year, as Superstars tend to use their full repertoire this time around, even utilizing possum attacks and leverage pins to get the jump on you. Tag-team AI isn't as busy as it was in 2K22 either. Teammates don't break up submission and pin-fall attempts as frequently as they used to, and you can strike your opponent's teammate when they're standing on the apron to inflict a stun state, so tag matches flow more smoothly. The AI does still have a tendency to throw you outside the ring a little too often, and there are some janky collision issues that will make you miss attacks you really shouldn't, but these are minor inconveniences in the grand scheme of things. The headline new match type in 2K23 is WarGames, which pits teams of either three or four Superstars against each other inside a cage containing two rings. Teammates enter the cage at alternating intervals, giving one squad a numerical advantage until everyone is in. The match doesn't technically start until every competitor has entered the cage, so much of the drama comes from these shifting power dynamics. There's a risk and reward element also at play, forcing you to consider whether you want to hit your big moves early on or save them until later when pin attempts actually count. WarGames is inherently chaotic in real life, and it's arguably even more so in 2K23, which is part of its unruly charm. It's surprising how well it all works. Even though you're locked inside a cage, the space you're working with is actually fairly large, so you have room to execute your offense, and pin attempts aren't broken up as constantly as they are when a bunch of Superstars are crammed into a single ring. At any one point, you could have a one-on-one match occurring in one ring, two competitors utilizing the space between the rings to inflict some unique offense, while everyone else is involved in an all-out brawl involving tables and chairs, with one Superstar standing on top of the cage, ready to launch themselves onto an unsuspecting foe below. A WarGames match in WWE 2k23Gallery Showcase mode returns once again, this time putting the spotlight on John Cena's 20-year WWE career. The 16-time world champion gives candid interviews to talk you through some of his greatest matches and rivalries, with you then recreating them by completing various objectives throughout each match as archive footage seamlessly melds with the in-game action. In a neat twist, you don't actually play as Cena, instead taking on the role of some of the Superstars who have defeated him over the years. When someone wins as often as Cena did--to the point where he was practically unbeatable at times--it makes his losses all the more notable, so it's a smart direction for 2K23's Showcase mode. Plus, playing as a different character in each match helps to freshen up the formula. Unfortunately, it's just not as engaging as it could've been. After Cena's pre-match monologue, there's no follow-up during or after the match to lend each conflict some gravitas or a sense of time and place. Instead of commentary, you're left listening to underwhelming crowd noises and a generic soundtrack that quickly begins to grate. While the transitions between gameplay and real footage are still impressive, there are also a few occasions where you have to sit and watch a match play out for a few minutes at a time. These moments can feel like an eternity, especially when it feels like you could pull off the sequence yourself. On the flipside, 2K23's MyRise is much improved over last year's offering. This is 2K's take on a career mode, although it would be more accurate to call it a story mode considering losses don't count unless they're part of the narrative. There are two distinct storylines to play through, one for the men and one for the women. If you create a male character, you'll suit up as The Lock, a world-traveled indie wrestler who joins the WWE as \"the next big thing.\" You win the Intercontinental Title in your very first match, but you're also saddled with an awful gimmick by management, so there's some immediate tension. If you create a female Superstar, you're cast as the niece of a fictitious WWE Hall of Famer. Your first match is a bit of a disaster, so you're taken off TV and have to work your way back up, attempting to forge your own path as a second-generation Superstar while emerging from the shadow of your famous aunt. Both storylines are immersive and a ton of fun, undulating between serious feuds and goofier moments. Occasionally, you also have choices to make that will alter the trajectory of your story and determine which Superstars are willing to align with you in the future. These range from deciding whether or not to use a chair to gain the upper hand or picking which rebooted faction to join: Evolution or The Hurt Business. Much of MyRise is very on the nose and self-referential, and the writing displays a love of wrestling that even extends beyond the all-encompassing bubble that is WWE. Unlike 2K22's offering, this year's game also isn't saddled with an over-reliance on in-game social media to tell its stories. The faux Twitter feed still exists, but it's used sparingly and is essentially a tool for getting you into some side quests and optional challenges. The bulk of the narrative is much more focused, with an overarching storyline and voice acting from the majority of the active roster. If there's one downside, it's that the loading times in MyRise are egregiously long. When you're jumping between matches and fine-tuning your appearance, entrance, move-sets, and so on, be expected to sit through the kinds of lengthy load screens that don't normally exist on PS5. Universe mode, MyGM, and MyFaction all return this year, too. The former still gives you full creative control to book your own episodes of Raw, Smackdown, and NXT, playing as either a single Superstar or an omnipotent booker who picks and chooses which matches to partake in. Visual Concepts has also added a substantial new feature to 2K23 that lets you choose from dozens of different rivalry actions to take place during each match, from a pre-match sucker punch, post-match kendo stick attack, or tag-team breakdown to a show of sportsmanship or a mid-match distraction from a conniving manager. You can guarantee a specific action will occur or leave it up to a coin toss to add an element of randomness to rivalries. It still doesn't compete with the collusion-fueled antics of the exhaustive story designer last seen in WWE 2K14, but it's a step in the right direction. WWE 2K23Gallery MyGM adds the mid-card US and Intercontinental titles this time around so your roster isn't just competing for a single championship. Other than this, it's still the overwhelming mode it was last year, as you draft a roster for your chosen brand, taking into consideration the budget, synergy between different types of wrestlers, and their heel and face alignments. Then you go about constructing a three-match show each week, all with the end goal of earning buckets of money, winning the ratings war, and eventually entering the Hall of Fame by completing various objectives. There are more General Managers to choose from in 2K23, including both Xavier Woods and Tyler Breeze--so you can recreate their Battle of the Brands rivalry from UpUpDownDown. Each GM has specific Power Cards you can trigger to change the tide of a show by sabotaging a rival or bolstering yourself, perhaps by stealing one of their Superstars or ensuring that a TLC match receives a higher-than-normal rating on your show. There's a fairly robust tutorial, but it still takes a while to wrap your head around how everything works and how best to put on a successful event each week. Fortunately, MyGM is no longer a one-and-done mode. You can opt to carry on playing for multiple seasons--with fresh objectives popping up to keep things interesting--so there's more time to get to grips with how it all works. If you didn't enjoy MyGM last year, the newest iteration isn't likely to sway you, but Visual Concepts clearly took some of the feedback on board to create a more comprehensive and rewarding mode. If you'd rather focus on simply competing in the squared circle, 2K23's card-based MyFaction is on hand to give you just that, with the caveat that it also wants whatever's in your wallet. Much like the previous iteration, MyFaction revolves around collecting cards, building teams of four, and then taking them into challenge towers, live events, and other challenges against the AI. The difference this year is that you can also fight human opponents for the first time, but this has the side effect of ensuring there will be a race to obtain the best cards. 2K23 doesn't have an online marketplace where you can buy specific cards using an in-game currency like similar modes in the likes of FIFA and Madden; the fastest way to collect new cards is by purchasing packs with real money. You can earn packs, single cards, and in-game money by playing the game, but attaining these rewards is a massive time sink. Considering the most expensive version of 2K23 costs an eye-watering $120, asking you to part with more money to potentially acquire a special card is egregious, even if it's mostly par for the course with these types of modes. It's equally disappointing that gimmick and attire updates are still exclusive to MyFaction when they should really take effect in every mode to better reflect the on-screen product. These misgivings aside, WWE 2K23 sees the series build on its immediate predecessor and return to form after hitting rock bottom (pun intended) with the infamous 2K20. Almost every mode has been improved--with the exception of Showcase and MyFaction--while the in-ring action is as polished as ever. WarGames is a fun and chaotic new addition, and the likes of Universe, MyGM, and MyRise are endlessly playable to the point where they could keep you busy by the time next year's WrestleMania rolls around.","length":15546,"tokens":3444,"chunks":[{"post_title":"WWE 2K23 Review - Head Of The Table","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/","post_date":"March 20, 2023 at 8:26AM PDT","content":"The legendary Shawn Michaels retired from pro wrestling in 1998 after suffering a career-ending back injury at the Royal Rumble.

It's not a huge, game-changing addition, but nailing the timing of this simple mini-game becomes more challenging later on in matches when your energy is waning, and there's something about imitating the physicality of a wrestler erupting out of a pin that adds to the drama.","content_length":852,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WWE 2K23 Review - Head Of The Table","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/","post_date":"March 20, 2023 at 8:26AM PDT","content":"You can still stick with button-mashing if you'd prefer, but flicking the right stick just makes more sense on a fundamental level.

There's a stronger emphasis on stamina in this year's game, with wrestlers slowing down the longer a match lasts. You can perform in-ring springboard attacks as well, and tag teams will work together in the Royal Rumble instead of immediately trying to eliminate each other.

Tag-team AI isn't as busy as it was in 2K22 either. Teammates don't break up submission and pin-fall attempts as frequently as they used to, and you can strike your opponent's teammate when they're standing on the apron to inflict a stun state, so tag matches flow more smoothly.

Teammates enter the cage at alternating intervals, giving one squad a numerical advantage until everyone is in. The match doesn't technically start until every competitor has entered the cage, so much of the drama comes from these shifting power dynamics. There's a risk and reward element also at play, forcing you to consider whether you want to hit your big moves early on or save them until later when pin attempts actually count. WarGames is inherently chaotic in real life, and it's arguably even more so in 2K23, which is part of its unruly charm.

When someone wins as often as Cena did--to the point where he was practically unbeatable at times--it makes his losses all the more notable, so it's a smart direction for 2K23's Showcase mode. Plus, playing as a different character in each match helps to freshen up the formula. Unfortunately, it's just not as engaging as it could've been.

It is, at best, an unfair challenge and, at worst, an impossible task. So, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel a second time, developer Capcom has doubled down on the brilliance of the original's design--elaborated on it, and finely tuned the experience. The result is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all time. If you're not familiar, the premise of Resident Evil 4 is straightforward: Leon S. Kennedy, the cool and handsome rookie-cop-turned-government-agent who you may remember from his escapades in Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City, has been sent to rural Spain to track down Ashley Graham, the US President's missing daughter. Yes, it's a \"save the princess\" trope but, even 18 years later, its juxtaposition against the survival-horror genre serves as an immaculate setup for the game's over-the-top set pieces. In this case, the princess is in another castle, but it's a castle besieged by parasitic infections and mind-controlled cultists, so you'll have to blast your way from a rundown village to a military island to get her back. While the core pillars of tense, up-close-and-personal action and careful resource management remain welcomingly unchanged, improvements to character development elevate the story as a whole. Now more than ever, Capcom is aware of the tone and humor of the game after it felt accidental in the original. This time, it feels like Capcom is leaning into it, striking a considered balance between heart-pounding horror and laugh-out-loud cheese. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

He's more than that: Now he's a cool dude with cool hair doing cool stuff who also acts like a human being. This is a Leon who carries the trauma of the Raccoon City incident from Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives more weight to his character and serves as compelling context for his motivation to save Ashley Graham. This time around, it's not just another assignment for Leon--it's a chance at redemption for the lives he couldn't save in Raccoon City. This narrative continuity is a strong thread that ties the remakes together with emotional heft, making this new era of the franchise feel stronger and more unified than the originals. Those concerned this added layer of humanity has changed Leon's iconic action hero cheesiness shouldn't worry, as Leon is still an absolute one-liner cornball. In fact, this aspect of his character has been turned up a notch. Through the chaos of blood-soaked battles where he faces down crowds of the parasite-infected Ganados, Leon still takes the time to toss out memorable one-liners. And it's not just for banter, as these moments are used to ease the nerve-wracking tension of fighting off villagers by cutting through it with some much-needed levity. Narrowly surviving each encounter feels like a relief, but when Leon throws in a casual \"bill me for the repairs later\" quip after shooting a lantern that erupts into flames, it almost feels defiantly triumphant. The world of Resident Evil 4 is grimy, filth-covered, and horrific, but it's also one where a government agent trying to save the President's daughter says, \"Not bad, right?\" to himself after suplexing a Ganado so hard its head pops like a water balloon. Capcom managed to take me to the edge of my seat in a desperate fight for survival, only to catch me off-guard and make me laugh with some comical quip. Its ability to repeatedly do this without disrupting the overall tone of the game is one of Resident Evil 4 Remake's crowning achievements. Facing off against the Ganado is more stress-inducing and terrifying than ever before. Their frenetic movements, unexpected lurches, and vicious attacks have all been intensified, making each encounter a panicked waltz of crowd management while fighting for breathing room and hoping you've got enough ammo and health to get you through the skirmish. You'll often be outnumbered on all sides as they juke and duck out of the way of your aim, fumble over each other to grab you, and push you toward the pitchforks, sickles, and knives wielded by other members of the horde. While the Ganados were similarly tricky in the original game, this time around their movements feel more tangible and weighted, which also makes the potential consequences of being backed into a corner or overwhelmed even more terrifying. Seeing Dr. Salvador, the chainsaw-wielding potato sack-wearing maniac, stomp through the crowd to try and tear Leon apart, resurfacing a fear that repeated playthroughs of Resident Evil 4 had long since dulled. These scenarios are absolutely heart-pounding and, despite the hair-raising tension, I couldn't get enough of it because combat just feels so damn good. From blasting a wall of enemies with a shotgun, to a quick parry of a stampeding pitchfork-wielding Ganado, to delivering a sweeping roundhouse kick that pushes back a crowd, the Resident Evil 4 remake's action has a kinetic brutality that feels like controlling chaos in the most satisfying way. Each combat encounter requires constant adaptation and tactical adjustments on the fly. Sometimes the situation calls for running bravely into a crowd of enemies to thrust a knife into a downed cultist before it stands back up as a much deadlier and more erratic creature. Others require a little creativity, like sticking a well-placed remote mine next to a crowd of enemies before switching to a shotgun to eliminate an enemy's wooden shield and then watching everyone go boom. Either way, there's a playground-like nature to combat in which you can manipulate the enemy's movements to your advantage, such as luring an enemy into their own bear trap or parrying a Molotov cocktail back at someone, engulfing a crowd in flames. It all feels punchy, visceral, and badass to pull off. This was the case with the original, but it is further amplified in the remake thanks to a greater variety of enemies--some of which are entirely new--while other returning ones have been reimagined in terrifying new ways. Without spoiling too much, some enemies now change the dynamic of how crowds act, often pulling the rug out from under my feet just as I had become comfortable in combat, forcing me to contend with a whole new level of stress. Leon has, of course, been given more versatility to take on the more capable and deadly Ganados. Fundamentally, the absence of tank controls means he's much easier to control in the heat of battle, but now he also has the ability to utilize stealth and his trusty knife-fighting skills. Knives now have durability (a carryover from Resident Evil 2 Remake), with each use slightly damaging it. Knives can now be used to parry nearly every attack by hitting a button just as an enemy strikes, and to instantly break free when being grabbed. These new additions elevate the tango of violence when dealing with a crowd of enemies by creating a sense of momentum. Each fight can quickly become a dance of maneuvering weapons, managing resources, and executing parries. And being able to cycle back and forth between these actions in quick succession makes it feel like you're fighting as hard to survive as the Ganados are to kill you. If your trusty knife breaks, you'll have to scavenge for inferior knives that are considerably less durable until you can repair yours. And even then, you'll need to have the space to store them in your attache case. Naturally, resource management is once again a major pillar of the Resident Evil 4 remake, as is the fiendishly compelling meta-game of organizing the contents of your case to fit together herbs, gunpowder, weapons, and crafting resources like tetrominoes. For those that would rather skip this, you can also hit a button to have everything automatically arrange itself.[Resident Evil 4] is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all timeResident Evil 4 Remake is full of smart quality-of-life changes that build on what the original revolutionized, with the strongest example of this being the change in combat capabilities for Ashley Graham. Thankfully, Ashley no longer has a health bar for you to manage with your own resources as you escort her. Instead, when Ashley is injured, she'll become incapacitated, forcing you to juke around enemies in order to get to her and bring her back to her feet. This is much less punishing on the player than outright failure but maintains the tension of the cooperative dynamic by forcing you to suddenly shift priorities to save her, while also ensuring enemies don't carry her away by taking them out. While the original game made it very easy (comically so, at times) to trivialize this aspect of gameplay by ordering Ashley to hide in garbage cans while you dealt with crowds of foes, this time around, hiding spots are few and far between. That's a welcome change, as it makes protecting her much more ingrained into combat, while avoiding the feeling that she's just an object you have to keep safe, which often came off as dehumanizing in the original. Like Leon, Ashley Graham is more fleshed-out and believable. She retains that 20-year-old sensibility and reacts as such, screaming in horror and shock at the sight of a parasite erupting from a cultist's head, but it's never overstated. Resident Evil 4 has struck a nice balance of allowing Leon and Ashley to communicate from time to time without overstaying its welcome and falling into the protagonist-who-talks-too-much trend that has become prevalent in games in recent years. Instead, they'll check in on one another after fights to ask if they're doing alright. Ashley will compliment Leon with a, \"Wow, that was a nice shot\" after you pop the head of a cultist with a sniper rifle. There are little extra added conversations that allow the friendship between them to develop, but it never distracts from the core of the gameplay or undermines the tension of the game. Across the board, characters are no longer the one-note plot devices they were in the original. Luis Serra, for example, is given a little extra screen time that better establishes his stakes in the overarching plot. And don't worry: Like Leon, his suave charm and \"hey, gotta smoke\" quips remain intact. He's still a leather jacket-wearing lady killer who slings one-liners and wields pistols like he's a cowboy out of a spaghetti western. Even Krauser, the '80s action movie archetypal antagonist who seemed to walk right out of movies like Commando, feels more well-rounded thanks to further context around his stakes and presence in the narrative. Some characters, however, have been given more flavor than depth--specifically the Merchant. His iconic voice has changed, but this is a new version of the Merchant who is iconic in his own right and stands as one of the most memorable characters in the franchise, despite only being a walking and talking pawn shop. He remains a mysterious figure you'll find throughout the world, but now with a few extra lines in his arsenal that you'll be saying as much as you said, \"What're ya buyin'?\"--I've been repeating, \"Remember, fun rhymes with gun for a reason!\" to myself non-stop. When you're not covering yourself \"with the stench of battle,\" as the Merchant likes to say, you'll have the opportunity to go off the beaten path to track down treasure, as well as complete requests that the Merchant has placed around the environment for you to find. Some are scavenger hunts like finding a gold chicken egg, while others entail hunting down fiercer and more unruly enemies that require a little backtracking to get to. In exchange for completing these requests, you'll receive spinel gems that you can trade for treasure maps, special item upgrades, and more resources. The requests create more incentive to explore the world but never interrupt the flow and pacing of the game, as they often lead you back down familiar paths with newly gained items like special keys to unlock cabinets and devices that hold treasure. These side missions don't feel like chores or checklists to complete, as the requests are naturally paced along with the game's narrative and given a little story flavor to ground them in the world. I welcomed them, as they only prolonged my chance to wander around in a world I love spending time in, even if that meant trudging through decrepit villages or the fog-covered floors of a gothic horror castle again. Even as Leon's mission takes him to some of the less visually interesting areas in the latter chapters of the game (a carryover from the original Resident Evil 4), the remake still manages to retain a remarkable balance of bombastic action intensity and nail-biting combat scenarios. Where the original game started to lose its steam, the remake manages to keep the experience on track by considerably changing what I had come to know so well from the original. Some sections of the original game have been honed, trimmed down, and reorganized to fit better into the flow and also within the environment. The first encounter with the blind, giant-blade-wielding Garrador, for example, has been better contextualized to fit in the torturous depths of the castle. As a result, the scene is even scarier and more stressful than before--it all feels turned up to 11. There are also returning boss fights, some of which are slightly tweaked, while others have received a welcome, more significant overhaul. For nearly all of them, I had a smile plastered across my face despite the dozens of times I've faced them in the past. I applauded when I was caught off-guard by new additions and audibly cheered when I found some of Leon's most iconic lines were still in the game alongside new ones I'll be repeating for years to come. There's a remarkably judicious approach to respecting what Resident Evil 4 was by preserving vital elements of the original, and realizing the potential of what it can be by introducing new ones. On the other hand, some sections have been cut entirely, but it is evident that this has been done with careful consideration and a deft touch. For everything taken out of the game, something new has been introduced to take its place. Capcom has clearly paid close attention to how these decisions impact Resident Evil 4's masterful pacing, and the delicate balance of combat, exploration, and some additional puzzle-solving that's light and approachable. Writing this review has involved putting the controller down and stepping away from playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and as hyperbolic as it sounds, that is much easier said than done. At the time of writing, I have finished the campaign, started a New Game+ on Hardcore, and also begun an additional playthrough on Professional mode, and I know this is only the beginning of many more playthroughs to come. Gallery Resident Evil 4 remake is the re-envisioning I wanted, but also not the one I expected to get. As a Resident Evil 4 purist, I feared that messing with the magic of an all-time classic would spell disaster. Instead, the Resident Evil 4 remake deviates from the original in many significant ways, but never compromises anything that made it revolutionary. It preserves that, recontextualizes it, and rejuvenates it in a game that is designed to keep veteran players constantly on edge, toying with what they remember to create fear through subversion. Although I have an intimate knowledge of the original game, the slight tweaks and unexpected additions kept me from ever reaching a comfort zone--I was never fully at ease, even with my knowledge of the original game. Capcom's strategy of using my knowledge of the original against me was a huge success. I won't not go into details, and some of these moments are more subtle than others, but every one of them felt clever and considered. Capcom has masterfully created a new version of a beloved game and continues to blaze a trail with its Resident Evil remakes. Like the Resident Evil 2 remake before it, the studio has used advancements in technology and design to modernize an iconic survival-horror and action game by placing emphasis on capturing the spirit of the original, and respectfully evoking the same sense of atmosphere and tone that the original developers aspired to. At the same time, it empowers the player with thrilling new mechanics and places challenges in their way to test their mastery of them. In that respect, the remake stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time.","length":18998,"tokens":4101,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"How do you remake Resident Evil 4, an experience that changed the way action games are made today? It is, at best, an unfair challenge and, at worst, an impossible task. So, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel a second time, developer Capcom has doubled down on the brilliance of the original's design--elaborated on it, and finely tuned the experience. The result is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all time. If you're not familiar, the premise of Resident Evil 4 is straightforward: Leon S. Kennedy, the cool and handsome rookie-cop-turned-government-agent who you may remember from his escapades in Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City, has been sent to rural Spain to track down Ashley Graham, the US President's missing daughter.","content_length":876,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Yes, it's a \"save the princess\" trope but, even 18 years later, its juxtaposition against the survival-horror genre serves as an immaculate setup for the game's over-the-top set pieces. In this case, the princess is in another castle, but it's a castle besieged by parasitic infections and mind-controlled cultists, so you'll have to blast your way from a rundown village to a military island to get her back. While the core pillars of tense, up-close-and-personal action and careful resource management remain welcomingly unchanged, improvements to character development elevate the story as a whole. Now more than ever, Capcom is aware of the tone and humor of the game after it felt accidental in the original. This time, it feels like Capcom is leaning into it, striking a considered balance between heart-pounding horror and laugh-out-loud cheese.","content_length":852,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

This is a Leon who carries the trauma of the Raccoon City incident from Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives more weight to his character and serves as compelling context for his motivation to save Ashley Graham. This time around, it's not just another assignment for Leon--it's a chance at redemption for the lives he couldn't save in Raccoon City. This narrative continuity is a strong thread that ties the remakes together with emotional heft, making this new era of the franchise feel stronger and more unified than the originals. Those concerned this added layer of humanity has changed Leon's iconic action hero cheesiness shouldn't worry, as Leon is still an absolute one-liner cornball.

And it's not just for banter, as these moments are used to ease the nerve-wracking tension of fighting off villagers by cutting through it with some much-needed levity. Narrowly surviving each encounter feels like a relief, but when Leon throws in a casual \"bill me for the repairs later\" quip after shooting a lantern that erupts into flames, it almost feels defiantly triumphant. The world of Resident Evil 4 is grimy, filth-covered, and horrific, but it's also one where a government agent trying to save the President's daughter says, \"Not bad, right?\" to himself after suplexing a Ganado so hard its head pops like a water balloon.","content_length":799,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Capcom managed to take me to the edge of my seat in a desperate fight for survival, only to catch me off-guard and make me laugh with some comical quip. Its ability to repeatedly do this without disrupting the overall tone of the game is one of Resident Evil 4 Remake's crowning achievements. Facing off against the Ganado is more stress-inducing and terrifying than ever before. Their frenetic movements, unexpected lurches, and vicious attacks have all been intensified, making each encounter a panicked waltz of crowd management while fighting for breathing room and hoping you've got enough ammo and health to get you through the skirmish. You'll often be outnumbered on all sides as they juke and duck out of the way of your aim, fumble over each other to grab you, and push you toward the pitchforks, sickles, and knives wielded by other members of the horde.","content_length":865,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"While the Ganados were similarly tricky in the original game, this time around their movements feel more tangible and weighted, which also makes the potential consequences of being backed into a corner or overwhelmed even more terrifying. Seeing Dr. Salvador, the chainsaw-wielding potato sack-wearing maniac, stomp through the crowd to try and tear Leon apart, resurfacing a fear that repeated playthroughs of Resident Evil 4 had long since dulled. These scenarios are absolutely heart-pounding and, despite the hair-raising tension, I couldn't get enough of it because combat just feels so damn good. From blasting a wall of enemies with a shotgun, to a quick parry of a stampeding pitchfork-wielding Ganado, to delivering a sweeping roundhouse kick that pushes back a crowd, the Resident Evil 4 remake's action has a kinetic brutality that feels like controlling chaos in the most satisfying way. Each combat encounter requires constant adaptation and tactical adjustments on the fly.","content_length":987,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Sometimes the situation calls for running bravely into a crowd of enemies to thrust a knife into a downed cultist before it stands back up as a much deadlier and more erratic creature. Others require a little creativity, like sticking a well-placed remote mine next to a crowd of enemies before switching to a shotgun to eliminate an enemy's wooden shield and then watching everyone go boom. Either way, there's a playground-like nature to combat in which you can manipulate the enemy's movements to your advantage, such as luring an enemy into their own bear trap or parrying a Molotov cocktail back at someone, engulfing a crowd in flames. It all feels punchy, visceral, and badass to pull off. This was the case with the original, but it is further amplified in the remake thanks to a greater variety of enemies--some of which are entirely new--while other returning ones have been reimagined in terrifying new ways.","content_length":919,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Without spoiling too much, some enemies now change the dynamic of how crowds act, often pulling the rug out from under my feet just as I had become comfortable in combat, forcing me to contend with a whole new level of stress. Leon has, of course, been given more versatility to take on the more capable and deadly Ganados. Fundamentally, the absence of tank controls means he's much easier to control in the heat of battle, but now he also has the ability to utilize stealth and his trusty knife-fighting skills. Knives now have durability (a carryover from Resident Evil 2 Remake), with each use slightly damaging it. Knives can now be used to parry nearly every attack by hitting a button just as an enemy strikes, and to instantly break free when being grabbed. These new additions elevate the tango of violence when dealing with a crowd of enemies by creating a sense of momentum.","content_length":885,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Each fight can quickly become a dance of maneuvering weapons, managing resources, and executing parries. And being able to cycle back and forth between these actions in quick succession makes it feel like you're fighting as hard to survive as the Ganados are to kill you. If your trusty knife breaks, you'll have to scavenge for inferior knives that are considerably less durable until you can repair yours. And even then, you'll need to have the space to store them in your attache case. Naturally, resource management is once again a major pillar of the Resident Evil 4 remake, as is the fiendishly compelling meta-game of organizing the contents of your case to fit together herbs, gunpowder, weapons, and crafting resources like tetrominoes.","content_length":745,"content_tokens":154,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"For those that would rather skip this, you can also hit a button to have everything automatically arrange itself.[Resident Evil 4] is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all timeResident Evil 4 Remake is full of smart quality-of-life changes that build on what the original revolutionized, with the strongest example of this being the change in combat capabilities for Ashley Graham.

While the original game made it very easy (comically so, at times) to trivialize this aspect of gameplay by ordering Ashley to hide in garbage cans while you dealt with crowds of foes, this time around, hiding spots are few and far between. That's a welcome change, as it makes protecting her much more ingrained into combat, while avoiding the feeling that she's just an object you have to keep safe, which often came off as dehumanizing in the original. Like Leon, Ashley Graham is more fleshed-out and believable. She retains that 20-year-old sensibility and reacts as such, screaming in horror and shock at the sight of a parasite erupting from a cultist's head, but it's never overstated.","content_length":936,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Resident Evil 4 has struck a nice balance of allowing Leon and Ashley to communicate from time to time without overstaying its welcome and falling into the protagonist-who-talks-too-much trend that has become prevalent in games in recent years. Instead, they'll check in on one another after fights to ask if they're doing alright. Ashley will compliment Leon with a, \"Wow, that was a nice shot\" after you pop the head of a cultist with a sniper rifle. There are little extra added conversations that allow the friendship between them to develop, but it never distracts from the core of the gameplay or undermines the tension of the game. Across the board, characters are no longer the one-note plot devices they were in the original. Luis Serra, for example, is given a little extra screen time that better establishes his stakes in the overarching plot.","content_length":855,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"And don't worry: Like Leon, his suave charm and \"hey, gotta smoke\" quips remain intact. He's still a leather jacket-wearing lady killer who slings one-liners and wields pistols like he's a cowboy out of a spaghetti western. Even Krauser, the '80s action movie archetypal antagonist who seemed to walk right out of movies like Commando, feels more well-rounded thanks to further context around his stakes and presence in the narrative. Some characters, however, have been given more flavor than depth--specifically the Merchant. His iconic voice has changed, but this is a new version of the Merchant who is iconic in his own right and stands as one of the most memorable characters in the franchise, despite only being a walking and talking pawn shop.","content_length":751,"content_tokens":162,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"He remains a mysterious figure you'll find throughout the world, but now with a few extra lines in his arsenal that you'll be saying as much as you said, \"What're ya buyin'?\"--I've been repeating, \"Remember, fun rhymes with gun for a reason!\" to myself non-stop. When you're not covering yourself \"with the stench of battle,\" as the Merchant likes to say, you'll have the opportunity to go off the beaten path to track down treasure, as well as complete requests that the Merchant has placed around the environment for you to find. Some are scavenger hunts like finding a gold chicken egg, while others entail hunting down fiercer and more unruly enemies that require a little backtracking to get to.

These side missions don't feel like chores or checklists to complete, as the requests are naturally paced along with the game's narrative and given a little story flavor to ground them in the world. I welcomed them, as they only prolonged my chance to wander around in a world I love spending time in, even if that meant trudging through decrepit villages or the fog-covered floors of a gothic horror castle again. Even as Leon's mission takes him to some of the less visually interesting areas in the latter chapters of the game (a carryover from the original Resident Evil 4), the remake still manages to retain a remarkable balance of bombastic action intensity and nail-biting combat scenarios.","content_length":948,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - Stranga, Stranga, Now That's A Remake","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/","post_date":"March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDT","content":"Where the original game started to lose its steam, the remake manages to keep the experience on track by considerably changing what I had come to know so well from the original.

The first encounter with the blind, giant-blade-wielding Garrador, for example, has been better contextualized to fit in the torturous depths of the castle. As a result, the scene is even scarier and more stressful than before--it all feels turned up to 11.

In place of the self-assured dominatrix we know and love is a timid young girl who is far more comfortable clutching a stuffed animal than she is a pistol. Instead of large-scale, action-packed set pieces and the mainline series' unapologetically over-the-top style, we are treated to enchanted forests, well-worn book pages adorned with soft illustrations, and gentle, childlike curiosity. As such, the first few hours I spent with Bayonetta Origins were filled with complete and utter confusion. I couldn't find the connection between Bayonetta Origins and the Bayonetta trilogy, or the threads that connected the two experiences to one another. But thankfully, the team behind Bayonetta Origins could. Bayonetta Origins is an achievement, both within the Bayonetta series and games as a whole.

The charming adventure-puzzler is also just delightful to play, and is far more than what it appears on the surface.

After witnessing her mother's imprisonment due to a forbidden romance with Cereza's father, the young girl is forced to seek refuge under the tutelage of a powerful witch who lives on the outskirts of the forbidden Avalon forest. Her teacher is firm-yet-kind--clearly intended to show in part where Bayonetta's cool demeanor comes from--but is often frustrated by Cereza's cowardice. As such, when a spirit visits Cereza and tells her that the courage she needs to become a proper witch and rescue her mother lies deep in Avalon, the young witch quickly sets off in search of it. Cereza faces Avalon ForestIn Bayonetta Origins, you control both Cereza and Cheshire simultaneously, with all of Cereza's controls assigned to the left JoyCon while all of Cheshire's are located on the right. Similar to any Hazelight production (It Takes Two, A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons), the game is filled with asymmetrical puzzles that require you to explore your environment and use both characters' various talents to progress. For Cereza, this means using her magic to bring helpful plants to life and stun enemies, as well as taking advantage of her small frame to cross vines. Cheshire, on the other hand, utilizes his brute strength, large size, and elemental powers he slowly unlocks to blaze ahead. When Cheshire can't cross a particular area, Cereza steps in to create a path. When Cereza can't reach a high ledge, Cheshire allows himself to shrink down into his stuffed animal form and be tossed to the once inaccessible ledge. While not particularly difficult, the puzzles are well-balanced, interesting, and continuously build in small ways, properly preparing you for what line of thinking the next obstacle might require. With this style of gameplay and the nature of the controls, there were a few instances where I felt my wires get a bit crossed and I'd accidentally move Cheshire rather than Cereza or vice versa. Thankfully the consequences for this are never dire and I found that as I progressed these mix ups happened less and less. Considering all the actions you can take as both members of the demonic duo--the game's skill tree is quite dense--the mapping is actually incredibly intuitive, and makes for the smoothest and most exciting single-button combat I've seen executed in a game. A large reason why the game's combat is as satisfying as it is is because of how the puzzle aspect of the game also extends to your encounters. The vast majority of enemies you square off against require either Cheshire's elemental abilities or Cereza's magic--which takes shape as a sort of small-scale rhythm game--to make them vulnerable to attack. This makes battles--and particularly the challenging Tir na nOgs stages, which feel somewhat like more combat-oriented Breath of the Wild shrines--require quick thinking and careful coordination on the players' part. To make matters more exciting, as enemy types and the number of waves you face off against expand, so does the feeling that you truly are playing an action-packed Bayonetta game--albeit very different from what's come before. Cereza walks along a vineThat said, players might find that Bayonetta Origins' combat is where the aforementioned crossed wires problem tends to happen the most--and is the most frustrating. While I found the technique of frequently recalling Cheshire in order to narrow my attention to one character to control, the bulk of the time you need to be playing as both, which can result in some fairly inelegant gameplay at times. Additionally, this complexity can feel a bit at odds with the light-hearted and inviting nature of the game. Though the game's story and world make this an easy recommendation for younger players, the controls could make the experience a bit of a struggle. This feeling continues to grow the further you progress in the game. While I won't delve into spoiler territory--frankly the game's story and callbacks are too special to want to ruin them--it impressed me how much Bayonetta Origins begins in one place and lightly dances towards another we are more familiar with. Thankfully, however, crossing this bridge does not correlate to a change in tone. I was worried as Cereza grew more competent and confident the game might force sexuality on the young girl and rob the game of its childlike wonder. I can assure you it does not, but rather allows Cereza to be a child discovering her strength and confidence in different ways before delving into the world of guns and leather.<img alt=\"Cereza laments to her Cheshire plushie\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4111647-img_4643. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4111647-img_4643. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4111647-img_4643. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Cereza laments to her Cheshire plushieAnd aside from the sheer inappropriateness that would have accompanied that tonal shift, Bayonetta Origins is so charming I didn't want to watch it contort itself into something more familiar--I wanted to savor every second of this game that felt too unique to exist as a part of the Bayonetta series. And sure, there are aspects that overlap and portions of the game that connect Bayonetta Origins to the mainline trilogy in necessary ways, but its focus, direction, and the confidence it exudes in both, never change. Though previous Bayonetta games also divided their narratives into chapters, the chapters in Bayonetta Origins are far more literal, as the story is told as if it is a children's book. A tender, matronly woman narrates the tale, adding in unique voices for certain characters, such as the ever-grumpy Cheshire, while illustrations fade in and out on the weathered pages. The game as a whole has a whimsical, painterly quality to it that perfectly suits its sense of wonder, and uses color and camera angles to create spectacles that add a bit of grandeur and magic to the intimate experience. Though the Nintendo Switch might not be able to keep up with its fellow current gen consoles graphically, Bayonetta Origins is a great example of how developers can combat that by focusing on artistry rather than fidelity. It is important to note, though, that the game's more free-flowing art style looks much sharper in portable mode.<img alt=\"Cereza and Cheshire look upon a resting spot\" src=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Cereza and Cheshire look upon a resting spotHowever, all of this pales into how sweet and affecting the Bayonetta Origins narrative is. For years now, the games industry has called for games to showcase motherhood, and this game is absolutely Platinum Games' triumphant attempt to satiate that need. Additionally, Cereza is every bit as charismatic as the older version of herself in this game. Her lines are delivered with sincerity, youthful joy, and emotion, and her moral compass and strength make her easy to love. Both Cereza and Cheshire bounce between cheeky and reluctantly compassionate with ease and pure adorableness, and it makes for a delightful dynamic that evolves into a truly special relationship. While some folks who raised eyes at Bayonetta 3's story might be wary at the direction Bayonetta Origins seems to be going in at its start, hang in there--you'll be pleasantly surprised. Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon is a testament to thinking outside the box. While I don't suspect Platinum Games will pivot to this new style of gameplay and storytelling in future Bayonetta games in the same way Breath of the Wild or God of War (2018) shifted the direction of their respective franchises, I cannot help but be thankful that the studio trusted the vision of its team enough to create this experience. Though with how fantastic every aspect of the game is, I understand why the developer did.","length":12234,"tokens":2895,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Bayonetta Origins: Cereza And The Lost Demon - Malice In Wonderland","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/","post_date":"March 14, 2023 at 9:51PM PDT","content":"The difference in direction between the Bayonetta trilogy and the newest entry in the series, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon, is impossible to ignore.

It is important to note, though, that the game's more free-flowing art style looks much sharper in portable mode.<img alt=\"Cereza and Cheshire look upon a resting spot\" src=\"https://www. gamespot.","content_length":827,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Bayonetta Origins: Cereza And The Lost Demon - Malice In Wonderland","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/","post_date":"March 14, 2023 at 9:51PM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg\" srcset=\"https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 1920w, https://www. gamespot. com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 1280w, https://www. gamespot.","content_length":418,"content_tokens":164,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Bayonetta Origins: Cereza And The Lost Demon - Malice In Wonderland","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/","post_date":"March 14, 2023 at 9:51PM PDT","content":"com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4111646-nswitch_bayonettaoriginscerezaandthelostdemon_scenery_03. jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\">Cereza and Cheshire look upon a resting spotHowever, all of this pales into how sweet and affecting the Bayonetta Origins narrative is. For years now, the games industry has called for games to showcase motherhood, and this game is absolutely Platinum Games' triumphant attempt to satiate that need. Additionally, Cereza is every bit as charismatic as the older version of herself in this game. Her lines are delivered with sincerity, youthful joy, and emotion, and her moral compass and strength make her easy to love.","content_length":696,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Bayonetta Origins: Cereza And The Lost Demon - Malice In Wonderland","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/","post_date":"March 14, 2023 at 9:51PM PDT","content":"Both Cereza and Cheshire bounce between cheeky and reluctantly compassionate with ease and pure adorableness, and it makes for a delightful dynamic that evolves into a truly special relationship.

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon is a testament to thinking outside the box. While I don't suspect Platinum Games will pivot to this new style of gameplay and storytelling in future Bayonetta games in the same way Breath of the Wild or God of War (2018) shifted the direction of their respective franchises, I cannot help but be thankful that the studio trusted the vision of its team enough to create this experience.

Destiny 2's latest add-on introduces major gameplay tweaks, an exciting new subclass to play around with, and plenty of fresh Exotic gear for your arsenal, but this is overshadowed by a disappointing campaign and a lifeless Neptunian destination that make for an underwhelming combination. Lightfall doesn't waste any time setting the stage, taking place shortly after the devastating events of Season of the Seraph.

From a city bathed in neon lights and a training montage as you master your new powers, to the introduction of a cast of characters that include analogs of loose cannon space-cops, maverick rookies, and grizzled veterans just one week away from retirement, Lightfall wears its not-so-subtle inspirations proudly. However, at the same time, the campaign has the depth of a direct-to-VHS action flick. The story is frustratingly vague as you chase down a paracausal MacGuffin, encounter slightly upgraded space rhinos, and grapple with emotional moments that feel hollow and unearned. Lightfall has an exhilarating start, but by the time you've experienced all eight of its campaign missions, it feels more like the unsatisfying storytelling of vanilla Destiny than a memorable '80s action picture. After nine years of being promised answers and chasing every lead imaginable, Lightfall essentially passes the buck to the rest of this year's seasonal content and 2024's The Final Shape. Much of the story is focused on The Veil, an object of immense power that you chase throughout the campaign, and is said to be the most important artifact in the universe. However, the reasons for this aren't explained. Calus, who has become the newest Disciple of the Witness, is as grandiose as ever and now resembles a Pacific Rim kaiju decked out in armored kitchen appliances. Despite all this, ultimately he's nothing more than a hedonistic bullet sponge who falls far below The Witch Queen's Savathun, the gold standard for great villains in Bungie's sci-fi sandbox. After being built up as Destiny 2’s next major threat throughout Season of the Haunted, Calus is unfortunately treated like an expendable henchman serving the Witness instead of the grandiose conqueror that fans had come to know, love, and loathe over the years. Legendary mode, which dials up the challenge considerably, is a recipe for sweaty palms and victories that feel hard-earned as you overcome seemingly impossible odds. The new gameplay tweaks and mechanics introduced in Lightfall pair well with the Legendary campaign, which have several exhilarating moments that can easily slot into a highlight reel. From a dramatic escape through Calus' flagship to taking part in a Cabal civil war that throws everything and the cosmic kitchen sink at you, Lightfall's campaign is mechanically a fun gauntlet to charge through as you master Strand--even if the narrative drops the ball frequently. Your new Darkness subclass, Strand, is introduced without much fanfare, frequently appearing in the campaign as a major source of power that's barely elaborated on. While 2020's Beyond Light expansion made unlocking the Stasis subclass aggravating, the manner in which the first Darkness subclass was introduced at least felt like a meaningful moment for Destiny 2. But in Lightfall, Strand hits the scene after you poke around a random interdimensional wormhole, is barely elaborated on, and is primarily a set of reality-unraveling training wheels that you're given control of periodically throughout the campaign until you unlock it full after afterward. At least the quests surrounding Lightfall's campaign do a better job of fleshing out the expansion and providing solid reasons for you to go pick a fight with time-traveling murder machines. Destiny veterans will be used to this grind, but between new missions to claim the latest Exotics and the weekly Season of Defiance storyline--which is technically not part of Lightfall itself--the story told here is far more gripping and cohesive. The quests surrounding Lightfall's campaign do a better job of fleshing out the expansion and providing solid reasons for you to go pick a fight with time-traveling murder machinesNeomuna, the new patrol zone where you'll master the art of Strand, is a beautiful but desolate location to explore. Thanks to the populace being conveniently placed into cryosleep and their minds uploaded into Neomuna's cloud servers, the secret city that survived humanity's first Golden Age cataclysm is pretty to look at but has a desolate theme to its design, despite it being positioned as an extravagant metropolis built by humanity's Golden Age explorers. It's a location that lacks the magic that made Savathun's Throne World or Beyond Light's Europa such standout locations. It has all the usual trappings of a Destiny location, from lost sectors to the new Terminal Overload public activity, but but its neon-lit facade can't hide a lifeless design that's mostly populated by familiar public events and patrols that rarely deviate from the established formula that Destiny 2 has been using since 2017. Put simply, Neomuna just doesn't have the X-factor needed to make it an engaging location to explore. Thankfully, however, the actual structure of Lightfall's missions makes good use of the city to provide intense missions that'll have you on the edge of your seat. As for using Strand, this new Darkness subclass succeeds in shaking up the Destiny sandbox with its unique set of powers for each Guardian class. Titan Berserkers rend through enemies with frenzied claws, Warlock Broodweavers unleash a small army of threadlings to do their lethal bidding, and Hunter Threadrunners combine elegant Silkstrike attacks with graceful agility. Like Stasis and the reworked Light 3.0 subclasses, Strand also benefits from a system of Aspects and Fragments that are gradually unlocked after you finish the main campaign. So far, there have been some tantalizing builds to experiment with, and combined with the right Exotic, seasonal Artifact mods, and armor mods, Strand positions itself as an incredibly powerful tool for destroying cannon fodder enemies and weakening larger foes. With my main Warlock, I've set loose armies of threadlings while wiping out entire mobs of foes in one almighty blast, using Strand's Suspend and Sever debuffs to stay alive and shrug off enemy fire. The key appeal of this new subclass is its grapple feature, an ability that replaces your grenade with the option to latch onto mystical anchor points no matter where you are and swing into action. If you're prepared to sacrifice one of your key explosive powers, the Strand grapple is a fun addition to Destiny 2 that has plenty of utility, allowing you to grapple straight into enemies before you unleash a special melee attack, or if you're feeling brave enough, hitch a ride on a Titan using their Thundercrash Super right before they yeet the enemies in front of them into oblivion. Opposing Guardians are the Tormentors, deadly adversaries who shake up the flow of combat with their unrelenting might and ability to seal your powers if they get too close. Tormentors have a response to every attack that you throw at them and learning how to cut them down to size is a refreshing challenge to take on. Destiny 2's core gameplay still feels as polished as ever, and in typical Bungie tradition, when a major expansion arrives, hundreds of quality-of-life changes have further refined the moment-to-moment gunplay. The developer has been releasing exhaustive breakdowns on these changes, which range from granular tweaks and the introduction of new systems designed to bring new players to the worlds of Destiny 2, to a completely overhauled buildcrafting system and the highly requested inclusion of character loadouts. For longtime players, the armor mod system is one of the most drastic changes to player investment. Gone are the days of transmatting into Ada-1's workshop to see if she has that one mod that you've been looking for, as Bungie has introduced a new suite of mods that can work on their respective armor pieces regardless of type affinity. This is Bungie pressing the reset key on loadouts built up over years of previous expansions and seasons, creating an even playing field for players of all skill levels to experiment with as they create their perfect Guardian build. Gallery The armor mods mechanic has also adopted a few ideas from the transmog system, creating a more intuitive menu for you to slot mods in and quickly preview your build before you commit to it. Jettisoning clunky menus and making good use of a revamped seasonal artifact means you can get into fighting shape much more quickly. That simplicity makes Destiny 2 more inviting, and with the option to save and switch between several loadouts instantly, Lightfall's gameplay enhancements create an exciting foundation for Bungie to build upon through this year's seasonal content. Guardian Ranks are another positive step forward, creating a defined journey forward for seasoned players and kinderguardians alike. This replacement for the Triumphs page essentially gives you an optional, more linear path forward to experience everything that Destiny 2 has to offer, ranging from campaigns to established PvE activities, Gambit, and PvP. Veteran players will automatically get a high ranking on this system, and working your way up to the truly impressive Guardian rank of 11 requires not only skill in every facet of the game, but recognition of your contributions toward making the experience better for other players as well. Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion doesn't make a good first impression, but beneath a threadbare story that relies on an exasperatingly fuzzy motivation for your Guardian, it still feels mechanically satisfying to dive into. Comparing it to the standard of excellence that 2022's The Witch Queen saga established only exposes the numerous shortcomings of Lightfall, and that's a shadow that the next year of seasonal content will need to step out of if Bungie wants to develop the expansion into something more than a middle-of-road entry that stumbles toward a final showdown that has been a decade in the making.","length":13094,"tokens":2777,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Destiny 2: Lightfall Review - Deft Stranding","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-lightfall-review-deft-stranding/1900-6418042/","post_date":"March 9, 2023 at 3:53PM PST","content":"With Destiny 2: The Witch Queen and its assorted seasons in the rearview mirror, 2023's Lightfall expansion has some big shoes to fill.

If you're prepared to sacrifice one of your key explosive powers, the Strand grapple is a fun addition to Destiny 2 that has plenty of utility, allowing you to grapple straight into enemies before you unleash a special melee attack, or if you're feeling brave enough, hitch a ride on a Titan using their Thundercrash Super right before they yeet the enemies in front of them into oblivion. Opposing Guardians are the Tormentors, deadly adversaries who shake up the flow of combat with their unrelenting might and ability to seal your powers if they get too close. Tormentors have a response to every attack that you throw at them and learning how to cut them down to size is a refreshing challenge to take on.","content_length":907,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Destiny 2: Lightfall Review - Deft Stranding","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-lightfall-review-deft-stranding/1900-6418042/","post_date":"March 9, 2023 at 3:53PM PST","content":"Destiny 2's core gameplay still feels as polished as ever, and in typical Bungie tradition, when a major expansion arrives, hundreds of quality-of-life changes have further refined the moment-to-moment gunplay. The developer has been releasing exhaustive breakdowns on these changes, which range from granular tweaks and the introduction of new systems designed to bring new players to the worlds of Destiny 2, to a completely overhauled buildcrafting system and the highly requested inclusion of character loadouts. For longtime players, the armor mod system is one of the most drastic changes to player investment. Gone are the days of transmatting into Ada-1's workshop to see if she has that one mod that you've been looking for, as Bungie has introduced a new suite of mods that can work on their respective armor pieces regardless of type affinity.","content_length":854,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Destiny 2: Lightfall Review - Deft Stranding","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-lightfall-review-deft-stranding/1900-6418042/","post_date":"March 9, 2023 at 3:53PM PST","content":"This is Bungie pressing the reset key on loadouts built up over years of previous expansions and seasons, creating an even playing field for players of all skill levels to experiment with as they create their perfect Guardian build. Gallery The armor mods mechanic has also adopted a few ideas from the transmog system, creating a more intuitive menu for you to slot mods in and quickly preview your build before you commit to it. Jettisoning clunky menus and making good use of a revamped seasonal artifact means you can get into fighting shape much more quickly. That simplicity makes Destiny 2 more inviting, and with the option to save and switch between several loadouts instantly, Lightfall's gameplay enhancements create an exciting foundation for Bungie to build upon through this year's seasonal content.

Veteran players will automatically get a high ranking on this system, and working your way up to the truly impressive Guardian rank of 11 requires not only skill in every facet of the game, but recognition of your contributions toward making the experience better for other players as well. Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion doesn't make a good first impression, but beneath a threadbare story that relies on an exasperatingly fuzzy motivation for your Guardian, it still feels mechanically satisfying to dive into. Comparing it to the standard of excellence that 2022's The Witch Queen saga established only exposes the numerous shortcomings of Lightfall, and that's a shadow that the next year of seasonal content will need to step out of if Bungie wants to develop the expansion into something more than a middle-of-road entry that stumbles toward a final showdown that has been a decade in the making.","content_length":1126,"content_tokens":213,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania Review - Pay ME Tribute","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review-pay-me-tribute/1900-6418041/","date":"March 6, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"I loved Dead Cells, but it never struck me as particularly Castlevania-like. The acclaimed action roguelike from Motion Twin certainly had some passing resemblance in some of its combat mechanics, but not so much that I ever made any association to Konami's vampire-hunting franchise. So when the studio announced it was making an expansion modeled after Castlevania, I was certainly intrigued, but also surprised. How would that work, exactly? Pretty well, it turns out, as Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a clever fusion of Castlevania homages and Dead Cells' structure, and helps to illustrate how Castlevania DNA has been a part of Dead Cells all along. The similarities between the two are cut into stark relief by their differences. Castlevania, and especially the Symphony of the Night sub-genre that serves as the basis for most of this expansion, is an exploration-based action game, with a castle full of tightly-knit secrets and clockwork-like precision to its progression gating. Dead Cells very much isn't that, as its roguelike biomes mix and match different pieces like Lego bricks. You'll recognize certain pieces after you've played it enough, but it will always be impossible to draw a consistent map or to tell a friend exactly where to find a secret key.

The Castlevania biomes are still randomized in the roguelike style, but the pieces do feel more oriented around puzzle-solving and secrets than in the main Dead Cells game. In fact, that's one of Return to Castlevania's most impressive tricks--it's still built around interlocking pieces, but the more secret-solving components don't feel contained to small, individual parts. It's almost as if the game is building a fresh, albeit relatively small, Castlevania map every time you respawn. The most recognizable homages, though, come in the form of new enemies and weapons. Those enemies range from the lowly Fish Man to hulking armored knights and, naturally, a confrontation with Dracula himself. You'll almost immediately find renowned sub-weapons like the Cross and Holy Water while making your way through the castle, and once you've unlocked them, they'll be available for upgrading with modifiers, like any other piece of equipment in Dead Cells. Seeing combat against familiar enemies with recognizable weapons really drives home how Dead Cells' remarkably satisfying combat has always felt like the best moments of Castlevania. The story is slight, consisting mostly of characters like Richter or Alucard showing up for a quick chat about where to find Dracula, but it's serviceable and helps point you in the right direction. The spirit is playful, with the Prisoner shrugging and thumbs-upping his way through this wild new adventure full of video game royalty. A few story moments reward you with powerful new primary weapons or skins modeled after Castlevania heroes, and wearing these skins even leads to certain characters recognizing and talking to you as if you were, say, Simon Belmont. Some of the best cinematic moments aren't story-related at all, but rather when you stumble upon some hyper-specific Easter egg referencing a moment in Castlevania history. At one point I sat and watched the ghostly dancers twirl around the screen for minutes, hypnotized, before eventually realizing the scene would go on forever if I let it. This being Dead Cells, it's also remarkably tough. Dead Cells was already known for its challenge, and Return to Castlevania felt slightly more difficult than the main campaign. That means it's ideally suited for experienced Prisoners seeking a new challenge, but it doesn't need to be relegated to endgame content. That's because the Castlevania content itself gives you such a steady stream of powerful new equipment that you don't necessarily need to wait for the stars to align with a run that gives you a good build. The fresh batch of weapons is also inventive in new ways that both fit within the Dead Cells milieu while also feeling iconically Castlevania. The weapon you get for defeating Death, for example, creates an electrifying rush to combat, encouraging you to pick off weaker enemies to empower you against stronger enemies. All of this makes Return to Castlevania an excellent little taste of Castlevania within the framework of Dead Cells, but it's only a taste. This is an expansion, after all, so it adds a few new biomes that, all put together, would make up only a fraction of the map space of a typical Castlevania game. It's also mostly straightforward, rather than requiring the traditional backtracking to open new paths with additional powers. The expansive scope of a sprawling environment is part of Castlevania's core identity, so its absence is a reminder that this is still Dead Cells with a Castlevania flavor. Depending on your luck and skill level, it will take a few hours to explore the content and reach Dracula, and probably a couple more to find and unlock all of the new gear. It wouldn't be a Castlevania without facing down DeathIt's also a Dead Cells expansion in that there are no easy shortcuts. This is a roguelike, after all, so even once you know the secret to finding Dracula's inner sanctum, it will take a good bit of legwork to get there. If you die--for example, against the challenging final battle with Dracula--you'll need to do it all again. Those qualities are part and parcel of this being an expansion to Dead Cells. It retains its own core identity, so the smaller randomized biomes and lack of shortcuts are just part of its nature. Those don't feel especially reminiscent of Castlevania, but the whole expansion is imbued with Castlevania flavor. Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a smart, frenetic fusion of a modern action-roguelike and classic gaming royalty.","length":7892,"tokens":1790,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania Review - Pay ME Tribute","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review-pay-me-tribute/1900-6418041/","post_date":"March 6, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"I loved Dead Cells, but it never struck me as particularly Castlevania-like.

This opening battle pits you against Zhang Liang of the Yellow Turbans, as you clash in a kinetic two-phase fight to the death. It's an intense skill check that challenges your prowess of Wo Long's mechanics almost immediately. In many ways, it feels like a rite of passage for the rest of the game and a bold statement of intent from developer Team Ninja. I initially loved how it forced me to adapt to the demands of the game's particular brand of Souls-like combat, yet the further I progressed, the more this feeling dissipated as I realized that this introductory struggle was little more than an unbalanced outlier, providing a much sterner test than the bosses following it. For many, this sudden difficulty spike will be a barrier to entry, halting progress a mere 10 minutes into the game. It's a shame Wo Long begins with such a sturdy roadblock, not least because this initial undertaking isn't indicative of the rest of the game moving forward. In fact, outside of this first boss, Team Ninja has crafted one of the more approachable Souls-likes in what is a traditionally challenging genre. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Most of the bosses in between were a relative cakewalk, to the point where I was able to cut down each one on my first attempt--usually in under a minute. I still had fun dispatching every single one, but the ease with which I was able to do so makes them lose some of their luster and reinforces the notion that the first boss is at odds with the rest of the game. The battle with Zhang Liang sets up expectations that never come to fruition, particularly when other fights allow you to summon help from either AI or human teammates. Team Ninja has experience developing difficult games, of course, with the likes of Ninja Gaiden and Nioh under its belt. Elements of both those games are present in Wo Long, yet its combat feels like a streamlined offshoot of From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, putting an emphasis on deflecting attacks and breaking your opponent's stance. I say it's streamlined because while enemies frequently unleash powerful unblockable attacks, you only need to deflect them by nailing the timing of a single button press. There aren't any sweep or grab attacks requiring different techniques to counter and avoid, so it doesn't have the same kind of depth. The timing window to deflect is relatively generous, and these attacks--known as Critical Blows--are clearly telegraphed, so it doesn't take long before you're misdirecting strikes left, right, and center. The challenge comes from being able to recognize which attack is coming and knowing when to time the deflection so you're not too early or too late. You can block regular physical attacks and dodge out of danger as well, but mastering the deflect mechanic is the optimal way to succeed. Plus, nothing beats the satisfaction of parrying an incoming blow and seeing the sparks fly as steel collides with steel. Wo Long doesn't utilize a traditional stamina system to rein you in. Instead, you have a Spirit gauge that either decreases or increases depending on your actions. You can build it by striking enemies and deflecting their attacks, then consume this positive Spirit to increase the power of your offense. Actions like dodging, mistiming deflections, performing weapon-specific special moves, and casting Wizardry Spells all decrease your Spirit, as does sustaining damage from an enemy attack. If your Spirit is in the negative and you take a hit that pushes the gauge to the lower limit, you become defenseless for a short period of time. This creates a balancing act where you want to build up enough positive Spirit to make full use of your repertoire without succumbing to this staggered state. Crucially, each enemy you fight also has a Spirit gauge of its own, so skirmishes often focus on whittling down your foe's defenses as opposed to concentrating squarely on damaging their health bar. You can lower the enemy's Spirit by simply attacking them, but utilizing special moves and deflections--parrying Critical Blows, in particular--will significantly deplete it. Once their Spirit gauge hits the lower limit, they'll enter a stunned state, giving you ample opportunity to unleash a devastating Fatal Strike that wipes out a chunk of their health. The variety of different enemy types you'll face doesn't make this easy, especially when you're dealing with multiple opponents at the same time, but Wo Long's learning curve isn't particularly steep. Once it all clicks, combat falls into this thrilling back-and-forth groove built around stylish deflections and quick bursts of over-the-top violence, and Team Ninja has also implemented a number of other considerations to ease players in. You have a double jump at your disposal, which lends the game a sense of mobility reminiscent of Ryu Hayabusa's exploits in Ninja Gaiden. There's a high degree of verticality present in the level design to account for this, encouraging you to leap onto rooftops and guard towers to survey the battlefield from up high. From here, you can perform a lunging strike to significantly damage an unaware enemy, while stealth attacks serve a similar purpose when your feet are planted on the ground. Both techniques allow you to dispatch a number of enemies before they even have a chance to strike back, so you don't always have to confront each foe mano a mano. This incentivizes you to pay attention to your surroundings as there's usually a way to get the drop on any unsuspecting assailants if you look hard enough. Outside of this first boss, Team Ninja has crafted one of the more approachable Souls-likes in what is a traditionally challenging genreThere are more subtle ways Wo Long softens the experience compared to other Souls-likes as well. Battle Flags, which are this game's equivalent of bonfires, replenish all of your health and healing items the first time you find them, without requiring you to sit down and rest. This means you can get topped back up and carry on without respawning all of the enemies you just killed, thus making exploration a tad more inviting. When you do die, you only lose half of the experience points you accumulated up to that point. You can still earn it all back by killing the enemy that bested you, but only losing half instead of the full amount prevents it from feeling like you're starting back at square one every time you die. These two examples might not sound like much, but they have a palpable impact on Wo Long's difficulty by deftly scaling back on some of the genre's more vexing idiosyncrasies. However, it's the inclusion of near-constant AI companions that does the most to ease up on the usual challenge. Wo Long puts a dark fantasy spin on the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history. Similar to how Nioh drew on its historical Japanese setting and relevant mythology, Wo Long weaves Chinese mythology and fantasy elements into its interpretation of this popular period in China's history. As a result, you'll fight alongside the likes of Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and others, with one or two NPC fighters joining you depending on where they fit in the story. You can still dismiss these legendary warriors if you want to go it alone, and you're also able to summon up to two allies if you start a level without any. The AI doesn't tend to dish out too much damage, however, and it has a habit of getting stuck on scenery. It has its uses, though, usually by keeping enemies busy and ensuring that you're not overwhelmed when fighting groups of foes. You can also replace these NPCs with friends if you'd prefer to play the whole game in co-op, with the game's difficulty scaling up to compensate. Or you can summon random players to help you take down a tricky boss or section, so there are plenty of options for those seeking assistance. The levels themselves aren't quite as sprawling as those found in the Nioh series. The game is still split up into distinct levels, with optional sub-battles unlocking throughout the campaign. These bite-sized stages send you back to previously visited locations where you'll clear a few rooms, face off against waves of enemies, or take on a boss. Sub-battles don't usually take very long to complete, and you're rewarded with loot and XP so they're worth doing. In terms of level design, rather than featuring long-winded detours that circle back on themselves, most of Wo Long's branching paths lead to dead ends with higher-level enemies and more loot. It's a tad disappointing that it doesn't regularly tap into the sense of both relief and wonderment you get from looping paths, but Team Ninja has opted for a different approach to exploration that feels fresh. Both you and every opponent you face has a Morale Rank that indicates their strength in battle. Simply defeating enemies will raise this rank, but it shoots up quicker if you kill an enemy with a higher Morale Rank than yourself. Wo Long still has a traditional progression system where you spend XP to level up stats like health and damage; the Morale Rank is there to indicate how your strength compares to the enemies you're fighting in a single level. It resets to zero at the beginning of each stage, so you tend to find lower-level enemies when you first arrive at a location. This isn't always the case, though. One path might contain an imposing figure with a significantly higher Morale Rank than yourself. You can still defeat these enemies, but it's a dicey proposition, as one wrong move is usually more than enough to kill you. It depends on whether you want to take the risk for the chance of being rewarded with a significant boost of your own Morale Rank. When you die, your Morale Rank decreases, but it will never drop below your Fortitude Rank. This separate but intertwined ranking can be increased by raising Battle Flags and Marking Flags. The latter don't function as checkpoints like Battle Flags do, but there are usually half a dozen or so dotted around each level, all with the express purpose of raising your Fortitude. Some are hidden off the beaten path, while others are guarded by powerful foes you need to defeat first. Not only does this encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of each level, but it also urges you to take risks and challenge tougher enemies you might not have otherwise bothered with. There's no glory in playing it safe, and taking risks earlier will pay off further down the line when your strength either matches or overpowers your enemies. Increasing your Morale Rank also gives you access to more Wizardry Spells. These mystic techniques can be unleashed by consuming Spirit, with each one falling into one of five elemental categories: Earth, water, wood, fire, and metal. Some of these spells are self-explanatory, letting you conjure the likes of fireballs, pointed icicles, and exploding rock pillars. Others are less obvious, such as wood spells being based entirely around lightning, while metal sorcery focuses on poisonous toxins. You can only equip four at a time, which feels somewhat limiting, but these spells do add an extra layer of depth to combat. They're not all offense-based either, with some spells allowing you to strengthen your defenses by coating yourself in rocks or restore lost health by dealing damage to enemies. There's also a rock, paper, scissors mechanic at play where wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and so on, but it's not something I ever really noticed. You can deflect elemental attacks with your weapon so I was never compelled to go out of my way to counter a magic-using enemy with spells of my own. The loot in Wo Long has been significantly toned down in comparison to Nioh and especially Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. Enemies don't constantly drop gear when defeated, so loot drops feel more spaced out and earned. Every item you pick up, whether it's a weapon or a piece of armor, has a star rating attached to it that's essentially a rough gauge of its quality. Baseline stats like damage and defense aren't overly affected by these ratings. Instead, the rarer the loot, the more special effects it has, which add passive bonuses to modify certain stats. You can visit a blacksmith to upgrade the main properties of your gear using various materials, so once I attained a full set of four-star gear I saw little reason to change unless I wanted to try out a new weapon type. The rest of the loot was quickly scavenged for more materials or sold for money, so there's still a moment in between each level where you'll typically rummage through all of the loot you want to get rid of. Gallery Wo Long has a fairly large assortment of different weapon types, ranging from straight sabers and dual blades to polearms and great wooden hammers. While the basic move set is the same for each armament within a single weapon type, each individual weapon feels distinct because of its unique Martial Arts. These special moves are flashy melee attacks that are stronger than regular attacks; the caveat is that they consume a portion of the Spirit gauge with each use. Some of these Martial Arts are focused on damaging a single enemy multiple times, while others excel when against a group or to close the distance on an opponent. They add another exciting wrinkle to Wo Long's combat, to the point where you're incentivized to experiment with weapons you might not otherwise try. Unfortunately, the game also suffers from a few technical issues. Stuttering and slowdown are both frequent annoyances on PC, where poor optimization ensures that altering the settings does little to alleviate these problems. I never encountered a situation where this hampered my ability to defeat enemies, so timing deflections wasn't affected by it, but it's still disappointing that another PC release is launching in such a haphazard state. It should be noted that someone else playing the game on PS5 didn't encounter the same issues, so it's likely these problems are confined to PC. The fact that Wo Long's demo features the first two levels and carries your save over to the full game is a boon for those who might otherwise be put off. It gives you the opportunity to challenge the first boss for yourself and find out whether it's the barrier to entry I imagine it will be for many players. If you can defeat Zhang Liang, the game that follows is a thrilling yet approachable addition to the Souls-like genre. Its parry-based combat is frequently stellar, and Team Ninja has made a number of smart changes to keep Wo Long feeling fresh, even if there's always a tinge of familiarity. It has its issues, but if you're craving a fast-paced action RPG built on satisfying combat, Wo Long ticks most of the right boxes.","length":16877,"tokens":3596,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/","post_date":"March 2, 2023 at 2:01PM PST","content":"The first boss fight in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is right up there with the toughest first bosses in video game history. This opening battle pits you against Zhang Liang of the Yellow Turbans, as you clash in a kinetic two-phase fight to the death. It's an intense skill check that challenges your prowess of Wo Long's mechanics almost immediately. In many ways, it feels like a rite of passage for the rest of the game and a bold statement of intent from developer Team Ninja. I initially loved how it forced me to adapt to the demands of the game's particular brand of Souls-like combat, yet the further I progressed, the more this feeling dissipated as I realized that this introductory struggle was little more than an unbalanced outlier, providing a much sterner test than the bosses following it. For many, this sudden difficulty spike will be a barrier to entry, halting progress a mere 10 minutes into the game. It's a shame Wo Long begins with such a sturdy roadblock, not least because this initial undertaking isn't indicative of the rest of the game moving forward. In fact, outside of this first boss, Team Ninja has crafted one of the more approachable Souls-likes in what is a traditionally challenging genre.","content_length":1222,"content_tokens":251,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/","post_date":"March 2, 2023 at 2:01PM PST","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

You can deflect elemental attacks with your weapon so I was never compelled to go out of my way to counter a magic-using enemy with spells of my own. The loot in Wo Long has been significantly toned down in comparison to Nioh and especially Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. Enemies don't constantly drop gear when defeated, so loot drops feel more spaced out and earned.","content_length":846,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/","post_date":"March 2, 2023 at 2:01PM PST","content":"Every item you pick up, whether it's a weapon or a piece of armor, has a star rating attached to it that's essentially a rough gauge of its quality. Baseline stats like damage and defense aren't overly affected by these ratings. Instead, the rarer the loot, the more special effects it has, which add passive bonuses to modify certain stats. You can visit a blacksmith to upgrade the main properties of your gear using various materials, so once I attained a full set of four-star gear I saw little reason to change unless I wanted to try out a new weapon type. The rest of the loot was quickly scavenged for more materials or sold for money, so there's still a moment in between each level where you'll typically rummage through all of the loot you want to get rid of. Gallery Wo Long has a fairly large assortment of different weapon types, ranging from straight sabers and dual blades to polearms and great wooden hammers.","content_length":925,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/","post_date":"March 2, 2023 at 2:01PM PST","content":"While the basic move set is the same for each armament within a single weapon type, each individual weapon feels distinct because of its unique Martial Arts. These special moves are flashy melee attacks that are stronger than regular attacks; the caveat is that they consume a portion of the Spirit gauge with each use. Some of these Martial Arts are focused on damaging a single enemy multiple times, while others excel when against a group or to close the distance on an opponent. They add another exciting wrinkle to Wo Long's combat, to the point where you're incentivized to experiment with weapons you might not otherwise try. Unfortunately, the game also suffers from a few technical issues. Stuttering and slowdown are both frequent annoyances on PC, where poor optimization ensures that altering the settings does little to alleviate these problems.","content_length":858,"content_tokens":160,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/","post_date":"March 2, 2023 at 2:01PM PST","content":"I never encountered a situation where this hampered my ability to defeat enemies, so timing deflections wasn't affected by it, but it's still disappointing that another PC release is launching in such a haphazard state. It should be noted that someone else playing the game on PS5 didn't encounter the same issues, so it's likely these problems are confined to PC. The fact that Wo Long's demo features the first two levels and carries your save over to the full game is a boon for those who might otherwise be put off. It gives you the opportunity to challenge the first boss for yourself and find out whether it's the barrier to entry I imagine it will be for many players. If you can defeat Zhang Liang, the game that follows is a thrilling yet approachable addition to the Souls-like genre. Its parry-based combat is frequently stellar, and Team Ninja has made a number of smart changes to keep Wo Long feeling fresh, even if there's always a tinge of familiarity. It has its issues, but if you're craving a fast-paced action RPG built on satisfying combat, Wo Long ticks most of the right boxes.","content_length":1099,"content_tokens":231,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Octopath Traveler 2 Review - Go Your Own Way","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/","date":"February 24, 2023 at 2:41PM PST","content":"Octopath Traveler was a pleasant surprise when it debuted a few years back. Its then-new HD-2D engine was a delight to behold, and the gameplay drew inspiration from some of Square Enix's most storied franchises: a deep Final Fantasy-style class and customization system mixed with the non-linear exploration and story of the SaGa series with a dash of combat that took cues from Bravely Default. These are great inspirations to draw from, but it resulted in a game that, while excellent, seemed to be struggling for a distinct identity. Perhaps the developers recognized this as well--with Octopath Traveler II, Square Enix seems to be trying to add new gameplay elements that give the franchise a personality of its own. And, for the most part, it has succeeded admirably. The core of Octopath Traveler II is a traditional, turn-based JRPG with many of the usual gameplay elements: towns and dungeons to explore, objectives to complete, etc. Where most JRPGs present a linear method of progression, however, Octopath Traveler takes a very different approach: You begin the game by selecting a \"main\" character from eight candidates. This character has their own unique background, story arc, and goals, and will serve as a constant presence throughout your playtime. After an introductory story chapter, you are then free to explore the world to your liking.

Some of them are comparatively weaker, but others command and hold your attention and keep you eager for more. Agnea's star-struck search for fame is notably bland, for instance, while Temenos' investigation into a murder plot by a religious cult and Throne's quest to kill the adoptive parents who raised her are excellent stand-outs. My personal favorite questline is the story of Osvald, who I chose as my starting character--a tale of a scholar who plans a Count-of-Monte-Christo-style prison escape and revenge after being framed for the murder of his own family by a scheming colleague. As soon as you finish the first part of a character's story, you're allowed to continue on to the subsequent chapters, as there are no hard barriers to progressing how you choose. That doesn't mean you can stroll anywhere in the world without a care, however: Some areas feature significantly more dangerous foes than others, and trying to stumble through them with a low-level party is quite an extreme risk--albeit one the game doesn't prevent you from attempting if you feel confident in your survival skills. In fact, going into risky places can yield some major rewards, but there's nothing particularly punishing about playing it safe, either. Octopath Traveler's lack of hand-holding compared to many other JRPGs may be off-putting at first--it doesn't offer much guidance aside from very basic tutorials--but the freedom it grants you to explore and attempt challenges at the comfort level you choose is one of its strongest points. One of the most interesting facets to exploration are the Path Actions unique to each character. Path Actions are available when interacting with the majority of NPCs, allowing you to engage with them in a variety of ways: acquiring items, learning abilities, gaining extra information needed to complete main and subquests, and even recruiting them as helpers in combat. New to Octopath Traveler II is a day/night cycle (which, thankfully, you can control at will) that changes which NPCs appear and what Path Actions are available to you. For example, merchant Partitio can buy items from NPCs during daytime at discounted prices, while at night he can hire characters as assistants in combat. There is overlap in the functions of characters' Path Actions, but judging which is most useful in a given situation adds a fun layer of strategy not typically present in JRPG town exploration. Octopath Traveler IIGallery Then we come to combat, which is the most satisfying and engaging element of Octopath Traveler II. The turn-based encounters build upon the foundation set by the original, emphasizing the need to strategically break down enemy defenses through the use of specific skills and weapons. There's also a \"boost\" system that allows you to significantly increase the efficacy of characters' actions by consuming the Boost Points that build up slowly during each turn of combat. The unique nature of each character extends to their performance in combat: Every party member has several individual skills and quirks that significantly affect their specific actions and the flow of combat as a whole Samurai warrior Hikari brings combat skills learned from NPCs into the fray, while apothecary Castti can mix items together to create helpful or harmful concoctions. Perhaps the most fun of these skills is that of Ochette, a beast-woman who can capture enemies and cook them into health- and status-restoring meat--or keep them to use their skills in combat. You don't have to be content with just the default skills of your characters, either. Like the original game, you can assign characters a sub-job, which will allow them to learn active and passive skills specific to each class, as well as equip a wider variety of weaponry. Playing around and discovering particularly effective combinations of gear, party composition, and skillsets is quite enjoyable and rewarding, with each new skill unlock adding something new to your overall repertoire--and hidden job classes and EX skills found over the course of the game add even more surprises and options. A new element of Octopath Traveler II's battle strategizing is Latent Powers, character-specific Limit-Break-style abilities that can dramatically affect combat when used at the right time. Every party member's Latent Ability is different: Osvald can transform multi-target attacks into intensely powerful single-target strikes, Throne can take an extra turn, Hikari and Ochette get access to new attack skills, and Temenos can break through defenses with any attack. Using these skills in tandem with a carefully crafted setup can create delightfully devious outcomes. For example, you can have others buff Osvald's magic attacks, attack to put the enemy into a broken state, and then use Osvald's Latent Ability and several boosts to create a massively damaging single-target spell strike that melts away enemy HP like butter. Finding effective tools and setups can allow you to get through combat situations that, typically, you might be horrendously under-leveled for, which yields immense satisfaction when all goes according to plan. Which, sometimes, it doesn't, but that's risk for you. Octopath Traveler IIGallery Octopath Traveler II isn't without some quibbles and frustrations, though. Every character that joins you starts out at a low level, requiring a time investment before they get up to parity with the rest of the party. Dungeon and field exploration is very basic, with little in the way of puzzles or gimmicks to spice up typical path-following--with only a few side roads leading to treasure chests taking you off the beaten path. Sometimes you're overwhelmed with choice paralysis as to what to do next in the various stories, while at other times you feel like all of your potential next moves are high-level adventures that may put you in way over your head. The risk/reward system for certain Path Actions is utterly nonsensical: I won't get my reputation in town tarnished for mugging or picking fights with people, but I will if I fail to entice an NPC to join my party? These aren't huge flaws by any stretch, but they are things that I hope will be ironed out and spruced up in potential future installments. Octopath Traveler II is an ideal sequel. It builds upon the foundations of the original by improving on what worked, establishing common pillars of design and gameplay--combat mechanics, Path Actions, freeform progress--that will hopefully carry forth through future games. It also iterates upon concepts and ideas borrowed from other JRPGs--the day/night cycle and Latent Abilities--that enhance the overall experience. Octopath Traveler II is a delight from start to finish, and has left me looking forward to seeing where this series will take itself in the future.","length":10545,"tokens":2288,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Octopath Traveler 2 Review - Go Your Own Way","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/","post_date":"February 24, 2023 at 2:41PM PST","content":"Octopath Traveler was a pleasant surprise when it debuted a few years back.

While I had played a few JRPGs before, none had hooked me the way Tales of Symphonia had. Despite my deep reverence for Tales of Symphonia, I haven't touched it since 2004. I don't really know why. I bought it on PC a few years back, but it just felt wrong to play that game sitting at my desk one random evening after work--almost as if it would tarnish the magic of that experience and the memories tied to it. However, with the release of Tales of Symphonia Remastered, I decided it was finally time to return to this world to see if it was as good as I remember. The result was a bit mixed. Tales of Symphonia follows a kid named Lloyd Irving as he accompanies the Chosen One on a globetrotting adventure. The Chosen One, Colette, instructed by divine prophecy, must \"regenerate\" the world in order to end war, famine, and hatred. It seems like standard JRPG fare, but the story is darker and far more complex than it initially lets on. Despite trying to do the right thing, Lloyd and his companions are confronted with moral quandaries that often leave a trail of destruction behind them. What makes the story so effective is how it rarely shies away from the consequences of our heroes' actions. Conflicts are rarely resolved neatly, and the story is better for it. What makes the story truly memorable, though, is the excellent cast of characters. To this day, Symphonia still has the best cast of characters the series has ever seen. Lloyd is a charismatic, hot-headed kid seeing the world for the first time. Genis is a clumsy spellcaster who serves as the perfect best friend and foil to Lloyd. While Kratos, upon first glance, appears to be a cold and detached mercenary, he quickly becomes a stoic father figure to Lloyd. There's a great dynamic between all of the party members that lead to some funny, heartwarming, and devastating moments over the course of the journey. Gallery The story and characters are occasionally held back by some awkward localization, but the lack of a proper quest-tracking system is what really halts the momentum. Like in the original, there is a Synopsis menu that summarizes your adventure so far and occasionally tells you where to go next. The problem is that these \"synopsis\" entries are a pain to sift through and can be vague at times, meaning you could be aimlessly wandering around the map until you stumble on a point of interest that triggers a cutscene. The inelegant, but often necessary, solution is to pull up a walkthrough. Tales of Symphonia also has a handful of side quests, some of which are missable. Once again, there isn't a reliable way to track these quests, so it's very easy to miss out on some. The presentation doesn't do Tales of Symphonia many favors, either. The user interface has received a few minor tweaks, but it looks nearly identical to the PS3 port released in 2013. The cutscenes are just as stiff and awkward as they were back in 2004, and the overworld is bland and lifeless. And the classic chibi-esque style feels at odds with some of the game's darker themes. It's hard to take some of the more emotional moments seriously when they are played out by cutesy characters. What sets the Tales Of series apart from other JRPGs is its real-time combat. While you can still pause time to change your tactics, manage unique attacks called Artes, and use items, the combat itself plays out in real time. Success in battle requires some light meter management and stringing together basic attacks with Artes. This basic combat loop hasn't changed much with subsequent titles in the series, but compared to Tales of Berseria and Tales of Arise, it feels stiff and painfully slow. Eventually, as you unlock more Artes, combos become intricate and, in turn, are more satisfying to pull off, but the early hours can feel like a slog. To offset the repetitive nature of combat, you can play as different party members. Each character boasts a different playstyle with unique Artes and bespoke combos. Spellcasters like Genis thrive on the edge of the battlefield slinging spells from afar, while the assassin Sheena, voiced by the incredible Jennifer Hale, uses elemental cards to attack her foes. No matter who you play, you can't escape the lackadaisical pace of combat, though. Gallery Although most combat encounters are relatively slow and straightforward, boss fights are a highlight. These demand a thoughtful party composition, clever tactics, and smart item management. Even on the normal difficulty level, players might find it difficult to coast through boss encounters like they would regular ones. While the fundamentals still feel a little clunky, the increased challenge makes boss fights considerably more engaging. On Nintendo Switch, I did run into a few technical issues in the first 10 hours. A couple of rooms within specific dungeons suffer from noticeably low frame rates. This doesn't carry over into combat, so it doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it's still jarring seeing a 19-year-old game suffer from frame rate issues on modern hardware--especially considering the original Nintendo GameCube release targeted 60 frames per second. Additionally, in the Town of Asgard, the game hitches up every time you enter a building. So far this is the only instance of this I've seen, but it's another bizarre issue that, although it doesn't directly affect gameplay, is weird to see nonetheless. More frustratingly, my game crashed twice in the first 10 hours. What made these crashes particularly painful is the lack of an auto-save feature paired with Tales of Symphonia's rigid save system. You can only save in certain locations, and some save spots are inaccessible without a specific item. That means that one poorly timed crash can erase hours of work. I've lost a total of two hours to crashes. Both crashes happened during extended play sessions of four or more hours. Since then, I've been saving regularly and relaunching the game every few hours, and I haven't had any crashes since. It's also worth noting that both crashes happened prior to a day-one patch, which is now available. Hopefully, this means players picking up the game on launch won't run into these same issues. Tales of Symphonia Remastered is still a captivating JRPG that's--unfortunately--a bit tough to recommend today given some of its dated exploration mechanics and rough presentation. A few modern conveniences could have gone a long way like auto-saving and quest tracking, but its emotional story regularly subverts expectations and explores the gray areas in what may seem like a straightforward adventure. All told, it's a thin remaster that doesn't shine a very flattering light on one of my favorite JRPGs.","length":7055,"tokens":1481,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Tales Of Symphonia Remastered Review - A Classic Regenerated","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-symphonia-remastered-review-a-classic-regenerated/1900-6418037/","post_date":"February 24, 2023 at 10:42AM PST","content":"Tales of Symphonia was a formative experience for me.

Though the pink puffball may not spend his free time go-karting or playing tennis, his catalog includes a ton of experimental games and art styles that stretch the limits of what a Kirby game can be. Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, a remastered version of the 2011 Wii game for Nintendo Switch, is in most ways a very traditional Kirby platformer. But its playful spirit, approachability, and a sizable new epilogue campaign make it much more than a retread. The main story component of Return to Dream Land is a colorful romp as you restore the parts of an alien ship, set to a joyful and buoyant soundtrack. The adorably bulbous alien Magolor crash-lands on Planet Popstar and seeks help from Kirby and his friends. Those allies are a major component this time, because Dream Land features drop-in co-op for up to four players. You can include any number of multicolored Kirbys in your ranks, but you can also bring along other familiar faces: Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, and King Dedede. Each has their own move set--Meta Knight is more agile than the weighty Dedede, for example--but only Kirby has the signature Copy ability to swallow enemies. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

There's a ton of contextual moves you can do with each Copy ability, which means you can pull off impressive juggles. But the enemies aren't much of a threat, so you don't really need to master the combat. It's a different approach from some other Nintendo franchises, which use simple move sets to pull off an increasingly difficult array of challenges. This one seems more aimed at letting players meet it wherever they are. The Magolor epilogue is a big chunk of new content with a unique power setWithin this simple framework, Return to Dream Land is especially adept at mixing different types of challenges for a steady pace of delightful surprise. You'll often find glowing enemies that grant a special Ultra version of your Copy abilities, with screen-filling effects. Holding onto these for a while will usually open a hidden path or grant you a special item, making it extra worthwhile to play with their over-the-top effects. The variety is especially on display when it comes to the occasional reference to other games, like a power-up that emulates Kuribo's Shoe from Mario, or a stage that treats blast barrels like a stage from Donkey Kong Country. The cast of characters and array of Copy abilities, along with homages to classic bosses like Whispy Woods, make this feel like a greatest hits collection. But it does include a pair of new Copy abilities that longtime fans in particular are sure to appreciate. The Sand ability is a cute new addition--giving Kirby a headdress that looks like a waving sandstorm and replacing his main attack with swiping a wave of sand at your enemies--but it's fairly similar to other existing Copy abilities. That makes the other new ability, the Mecha suit, the real standout. When gobbling up robotic enemies, Kirby gets a power suit akin to a Gundam, and his suite of abilities ranges from a long-range laser to arcing rockets. I grabbed a Mecha ability whenever I had the option, because it's just so versatile and fun to play. This all might make Return to Dream Land sound like a cakewalk, but it would be more accurate to say that it ramps up to a comfortable difficulty. Even during its hardest stages, I would only die once or twice, which made the overall experience breezy rather than frustrating. That should make it ideal for younger players looking for a gentle on-ramp to Nintendo's expertise in platforming craftsmanship. The co-op play also means more experienced players or parents can help guide younger players along, but for solo play, Return to Dream Land Deluxe features a new Helper Magolor feature. If you turn it on, you'll get a handful of helpful assists: double stamina, immunity from falling deaths, and a toggled-on option that automatically activates Kirby's Copy forms instead of needing to trigger them manually. All of this has the net effect of making a relatively easy game even easier, but it's a nice set of training wheels for those who need them. After you've finished the main story, an Extra mode opens up that presents more challenging versions of the same stages. It's a nice touch, but it would have been better to offer the option from the beginning, rather than force more experienced players to go through the story once just to earn the ability to do it again, but harder. The much more significant post-story addition, new to this Deluxe version, is an epilogue story starring a disheveled Magolor as a playable character. What sets Magolor apart from the rest of the Kirby characters is his wide array of magical abilities, each of which has extensive upgrades. These newly crafted stages let you gather upgrade points to make him stronger, and there's a real sense of progression as you discover new abilities and then juice them up. Since the stages are custom-built for Magolor, they feel like a real test of his own unique movement and skills, and special challenge stages are locked to having upgraded your abilities to certain skill levels so that you can conquer them. To my surprise, the final boss was a tough challenge that forced me to go back and earn more upgrades. The new stages also make use of visual flourishes that I didn't notice in the main game, like a rainfall effect. Playing as Magolor feels very distinct from the rest of the Kirby characters, but satisfying in its own way. His floating ability makes him very agile, and since he has access to his spells all the time, he's very capable in combat without needing to find a Copy ability first. My one gripe was with his dash attack, which was mapped onto the standard attack button when combined with running, so it would often trigger when I didn't mean it to. Rounding out the package is Merry Magoland, a carnival-like attraction with Magolor as its ringmaster, letting you take part in an array of minigames from across Kirby history along with two new additions. Playing them earns you stamps that fill up punch cards for masks of familiar Kirby characters, which you can then wear into the regular platformer stages. Plus, progressing through challenges in the minigames helps fill out the carnival setting with statues and other decorative elements. Gallery This is the clearest remnant of Return to Dream Land's origins on the Wii, right down to Wii Remote functionality that has been mapped onto the Switch Joy-Cons. These games are fine, but only that. There are a couple of standouts in the bunch, like Checkerboard Chase and Booming Blasters, but just as many duds. Most of them are so short that it doesn't feel inviting to go through the menus to play just once, but they're also not engaging enough to play repeatedly. There is a Magoland Tour feature that randomly mixes four minigames together, but there's no way to pick a mix or to sort them by theme (like motion-controlled games), so it never quite comes together. Merry Magoland is so-so as a distraction, and may appeal to younger audiences, but it's certainly not the main attraction. Fortunately, though, that main attraction is delightful. Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe feels like a very complete package thanks to a remastered platformer campaign, substantial new Magolor epilogue, and smart new additions like the Mecha ability and Helper Magolor mode. It might be a little simple for some tastes, but it's grand fun to get lost in such a sweet little adventure regardless.","length":9587,"tokens":2154,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land Deluxe Review - Kirb Your Enthusiasm","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/","post_date":"February 22, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"Mario is the most versatile character in the Nintendo oeuvre, but Kirby has to be a close second.

But the enemies aren't much of a threat, so you don't really need to master the combat.

This one seems more aimed at letting players meet it wherever they are. The Magolor epilogue is a big chunk of new content with a unique power setWithin this simple framework, Return to Dream Land is especially adept at mixing different types of challenges for a steady pace of delightful surprise.

The cast of characters and array of Copy abilities, along with homages to classic bosses like Whispy Woods, make this feel like a greatest hits collection. But it does include a pair of new Copy abilities that longtime fans in particular are sure to appreciate. The Sand ability is a cute new addition--giving Kirby a headdress that looks like a waving sandstorm and replacing his main attack with swiping a wave of sand at your enemies--but it's fairly similar to other existing Copy abilities. That makes the other new ability, the Mecha suit, the real standout. When gobbling up robotic enemies, Kirby gets a power suit akin to a Gundam, and his suite of abilities ranges from a long-range laser to arcing rockets.","content_length":944,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land Deluxe Review - Kirb Your Enthusiasm","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/","post_date":"February 22, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"I grabbed a Mecha ability whenever I had the option, because it's just so versatile and fun to play. This all might make Return to Dream Land sound like a cakewalk, but it would be more accurate to say that it ramps up to a comfortable difficulty. Even during its hardest stages, I would only die once or twice, which made the overall experience breezy rather than frustrating. That should make it ideal for younger players looking for a gentle on-ramp to Nintendo's expertise in platforming craftsmanship. The co-op play also means more experienced players or parents can help guide younger players along, but for solo play, Return to Dream Land Deluxe features a new Helper Magolor feature. If you turn it on, you'll get a handful of helpful assists: double stamina, immunity from falling deaths, and a toggled-on option that automatically activates Kirby's Copy forms instead of needing to trigger them manually.","content_length":915,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land Deluxe Review - Kirb Your Enthusiasm","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/","post_date":"February 22, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"All of this has the net effect of making a relatively easy game even easier, but it's a nice set of training wheels for those who need them. After you've finished the main story, an Extra mode opens up that presents more challenging versions of the same stages. It's a nice touch, but it would have been better to offer the option from the beginning, rather than force more experienced players to go through the story once just to earn the ability to do it again, but harder. The much more significant post-story addition, new to this Deluxe version, is an epilogue story starring a disheveled Magolor as a playable character. What sets Magolor apart from the rest of the Kirby characters is his wide array of magical abilities, each of which has extensive upgrades. These newly crafted stages let you gather upgrade points to make him stronger, and there's a real sense of progression as you discover new abilities and then juice them up.","content_length":939,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land Deluxe Review - Kirb Your Enthusiasm","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/","post_date":"February 22, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"Since the stages are custom-built for Magolor, they feel like a real test of his own unique movement and skills, and special challenge stages are locked to having upgraded your abilities to certain skill levels so that you can conquer them. To my surprise, the final boss was a tough challenge that forced me to go back and earn more upgrades. The new stages also make use of visual flourishes that I didn't notice in the main game, like a rainfall effect. Playing as Magolor feels very distinct from the rest of the Kirby characters, but satisfying in its own way. His floating ability makes him very agile, and since he has access to his spells all the time, he's very capable in combat without needing to find a Copy ability first. My one gripe was with his dash attack, which was mapped onto the standard attack button when combined with running, so it would often trigger when I didn't mean it to.","content_length":902,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land Deluxe Review - Kirb Your Enthusiasm","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/","post_date":"February 22, 2023 at 6:00AM PST","content":"Rounding out the package is Merry Magoland, a carnival-like attraction with Magolor as its ringmaster, letting you take part in an array of minigames from across Kirby history along with two new additions. Playing them earns you stamps that fill up punch cards for masks of familiar Kirby characters, which you can then wear into the regular platformer stages. Plus, progressing through challenges in the minigames helps fill out the carnival setting with statues and other decorative elements. Gallery This is the clearest remnant of Return to Dream Land's origins on the Wii, right down to Wii Remote functionality that has been mapped onto the Switch Joy-Cons.

There is a Magoland Tour feature that randomly mixes four minigames together, but there's no way to pick a mix or to sort them by theme (like motion-controlled games), so it never quite comes together. Merry Magoland is so-so as a distraction, and may appeal to younger audiences, but it's certainly not the main attraction. Fortunately, though, that main attraction is delightful. Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe feels like a very complete package thanks to a remastered platformer campaign, substantial new Magolor epilogue, and smart new additions like the Mecha ability and Helper Magolor mode. It might be a little simple for some tastes, but it's grand fun to get lost in such a sweet little adventure regardless.","content_length":879,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"Hogwarts Legacy is developed by Avalanche Software, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community. In this article, you will also find links to trans creators you can support, as well as charities you can donate to. It's difficult to find someone oblivious to the world of Harry Potter. For many it was a property that grew up with them, with both the book and film series persisting in the zeitgeist for decades. It's confusing then that it's taken this long to get a game that promises to deliver on the fantasy of becoming a wizard or witch within that universe; attending classes, learning spells, engaging in mischief, and exploring the grandeur of Hogwarts Castle. Hogwarts Legacy delivers on that promise, to a degree. Its adaptation of this universe is undeniably the most extensive yet, allowing you to truly explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas like never before. But it's also stuck too keenly in the present (and sometimes, past) of open-world game design, reducing much of what you do to repetitive checklist activities in a world that is disappointingly barren. Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the late 1800s, although you might be hard-pressed to notice that from the way characters speak or by the clothes they wear, which look ripped straight out of the films set in the late 1900s. You play as a prodigal witch or wizard of your own creation, this time fighting against a goblin uprising led by one particularly nasty one named Ranrok. This props up a predictable and surprisingly sporadic narrative, with main beats and progression only taking place every few hours as you complete the requisite quests around them, which are often barely related. There's so little screen time for many of the main characters that you struggle to get a sense of their motives, especially so in the case of Ranrok, who only appears to deliver a line or two to some subordinates before he disappears for a couple of hours. It robs him, and the story, of any sense of emotional tension, reducing it to nothing more than \"talented good student takes out bad powerful goblin\" by the end. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Being both a new and older student means you get to enjoy the thrills of learning some familiar spells from earlier years, but also have access to a wide range of more advanced ones as the year progresses. The initial introduction to each class is captivating, from partaking in duels in Defence Against the Dark Arts or being subjected to a screaming Mandrake in Herbology. These are some of the moments where Hogwarts Legacy is at its strongest, recapturing the sense of wonder that has made this world so enticing to so many. The mechanical components of each class, however, fall woefully short. The small minigame used to convey wand movements for each spell feels ripped out of the series' very first video game entry nearly two decades ago, while many of the activities introduced shortly after are brief, uninteresting, and usually used as a means to fill your map with many more instances of the same thing. They quickly extinguish any glimmers of hope that the school aspect to your time at Hogwarts will be as engaging as many of these classes might seem from the outside. After your introduction to each class, your engagement with each professor and their craft is relegated to even less interesting quests. You're tasked with completing two objectives before they'll dole out another spell, with the chores in question sometimes not even making sense for the class they're required for. Some you'll end up completing naturally as you explore or engage with other quests, such as those that require you to use certain spells on enemies or acquire particular potions. Others will, however, routinely force you to deviate from the fun, such as objectives that ask you to either purchase or grow a particular plant in the Room of Requirement (which can take upwards of 15 real-world minutes, not too unlike the artificial timers you'd find in a free mobile game). It was confusing to have progression routinely stifled by these activities, given that most main quests generally required a certain spell before they could be started. This growing collection of spells is most useful in Hogwarts Legacy's combat, which initially makes a strong impression. Basic attack and protection spells can be fired off with ease, with the combat flow mimicking a familiar setup of timing blocks and parries as you mash away at the attack button in-between. Advanced spells sit on a four-slot weapon wheel, allowing you to cast them using one of the four face buttons. They're filtered into red, yellow, and purple classes, each of which informs you of their overall purpose in battle. Purple spells, such as accio and descendo, are manipulation attacks that can control and move opponents, while red spells such as the fire spell incendio and disarming spell expelliarmus are all about damage. Used intelligently together, combat has a rhythmic flow to it that shines most when you're pulling off combos. Flinging a foe into the air, firing off some basic attacks and then suspending them there even further makes you feel incredibly powerful, but it's also an effective way to take down enemies that are happy enough to soak up damage from your basic attack. This way of using magic is foreign to how it's portrayed in the rest of Potterverse media, but it rarely feels out of place here. There can be some narrative dissonance if you ponder on it too long--why are professors at Hogwarts so comfortable with students fighting thousands of dangerous goblins and dark wizards and witches just off school grounds, for example–but it's easy enough to suspend disbelief for the sake of the satisfaction of getting to wield magic so freely. It's sometimes a bit too jarring, however, notably when it comes to the numerous Unforgivable Curses that you'll have the chance to acquire. While there's thought around letting you choose whether you want to use them at all, there's nothing really punishing about routinely using some of the worst spells known to this universe. Characters might mention their displeasure at you using them, but it never tangibly makes a difference to proceedings, letting them exist as just another tool in your toolbox for when you might need it. As you continue obtaining more spells, you're forced to assign them to alternative loadouts, with a maximum of four once you've unlocked them all. The way you swap between each of these loadouts, and in turn reassign which face buttons are assigned to each spell, is incredibly cumbersome. Outside of combat, you'll repeatedly have to dive into a menu and rearrange which spells are where, since you'll quickly obtain more than you can hold at a time. Swapping between each one while fighting also stifles the engaging rhythm of fights, and you can easily end up fighting more against your memory of which spells are located within which loadout than you do the threats around you. It ends up feeding into the repetitive nature of combat because it becomes far simpler to just stick with four basic spells that you never have to navigate away from, especially since they scale generously with your level and upgrades, while enemies don't really change meaningfully over the hours.[Hogwarts Legacy is] stuck too keenly in the present (and sometimes, past) of open-world game design, reducing much of what you do to repetitive checklist activities in a world that is disappointingly barrenYou'll engage with dark wizards and witches, along with dark goblins and a variety of fauna ranging from rabid wild dogs to gigantic web-slinging spiders. Despite the variety, it's fairly easy to approach each type with the same strategy, with only humans and goblins presenting slightly more of a challenge because of their color-coded shields, which you'll need to destroy with appropriate spells. Larger enemies are immune to the sort of juggling you might have become comfortable employing on smaller hapless foes, but they diminish any additional sense of danger they could've presented by featuring a grossly limited moveset for attacks. This is even worse with bosses, especially those repeated at the end of several key story missions, who only have two attack patterns you need to learn as you slowly chip away at their health bar. The repetitive nature of these fights makes you keenly aware of how they're artificially drawn out, sapping any real excitement from most of them. Almost every quest incorporates combat in some way, which doesn't help its repetitive nature, but many also give you chances to use spells in less obvious ways. With your assortment of manipulative magic, Hogwarts Legacy trusts your intelligence with spatial puzzles that sometimes had me pausing for thought before arriving at a satisfying solution. The best quests were ones that mixed this up nicely with combat, peppering a multi-staged level filled with puzzles with some brief fights to shake up the pacing. Perhaps the best example of this is an assault on Falbarton Castle, which featured a variety of high walls to scale with combinations of levitation and time-freezing spells, along with smart combat encounters in uncharacteristically tight spaces where a small misstep could be a long fall to death. It's capped off with a suitably climactic scene where you take flight atop a Hippogriff for the first time; it swoops down a nearby valley just as the Hogwarts Express is traveling past, throwing up thick clouds of smoke as it passes by. It's a quintessentially Harry Potter moment that feels ripped out of the main canon, and emphasizes the attention to detail that Hogwarts Legacy abides by in this regard. This attention to detail is most evident throughout Hogwarts Castle, far and away the most engaging area of Hogwart Legacy's expansive open-world. If you've ever tried to piece together exactly how all of its rooms connect, how staircases that move around join vital hallways together, or just where every little landmark is situated, there hasn't been a better way to get those answers to date. At times it feels like you're navigating an engrossing museum, taking small stops at places of magnificence such as The Great Hall or The Library, seeing students going about their day and small acts of playful magic firing off in the corner of your eye. It's visually gorgeous and inviting to pick apart, but also filled with small puzzles and activities that further encourage your exploration. It certainly might not have been big enough to contain the entirety of Hogwart Legacy's story, but its level of polish stands in stark contrast to the world outside of its walls. While Hogwarts Castle is grandiose, the only other part of Hogwarts Legacy's gigantic map that comes close to matching it is the vendor-laden streets of Hogsmeade. Ignoring the same two vocal cues that played every time I ventured there, the town itself is every bit as cozy as your character will frequently suggest, while also providing vital mercantile services for all your potions, equipment, and more. The areas surrounding both of these large landmarks are disappointingly barren by comparison. The Forbidden Forest is suitably eerie at any time of the day, but its visual impact is impaired by all the other identical forestry that stretches across all of the surrounding hills. Smaller villages appear throughout the map, too, with a handful of merchants and some side quests to accept in them, but these are even more cookie-cutter in their construction, to the point where it's almost impossible to tell one from another as you're exploring. Nothing makes this more evident than when you're flying across the countryside on a mount or broom. While it's unsurprisingly easy to pick out both Hogwarts and Hogsmeade from a distance, everything else blends into an indistinguishable blur of forestry and bare fields, which rarely invited me to explore it over fast-traveling between quests. To be clear, there are things to do within this visually drab open world, but they're usually just as uninteresting as their backdrop. Hogwarts Legacy's world is littered with an abundance of trivial activities to complete, the likes of which you'll be familiar with if you've kept abreast of modern open-world designs. There are enemy camps to clear out, flora and fauna to either collect or hunt down, pages from your collectible field guide to uncover, chests behind locked doors to rummage through, and so much more. It's meant to alleviate the time spent traveling to and from story missions while also offering monetary and gear rewards, but it's so easy to overlook entirely given how frequent those rewards are handed out in far more intrestings main quests. Problems arise, however, when Hogwarts Legacy forces you to engage with these mediocre side activities in order to progress. Many story quests are gated with both level and spell requirements, the former depending on your current numerical level and the latter on whether or not you have access to a specific spell. Experience is only rewarded for many of the activities strewn around the world and the various, albeit bland, side missions you can complete. Depending on how much you choose to explore Hogwarts Legacy's world organically or not, you can find yourself (like I did frequently) forced to take a pause from the main path and work through open-world missions just enough to continue, before being faced with the same hurdle again. Gallery The allure of better gear should offset the monotony, but it's so graciously handed out by defeated enemies that you'll find yourself rubbing up against your restrictive inventory. You start off with 20 slots that are shared across all five of your gear categories, which can be filled within just one or two missions if you're not making a habit of visiting a merchant to offload items or wastefully destroying them. Worse still is that the only way to alleviate this issue is to complete countless Merlin Trials across the map, all of which are one of a handful of small, quick puzzles repeated ad nauseam. Each milestone in this quest rewards you with four extra slots, and the requirements to the next one increases as you go, making it a tedious slog if all you want to do is reduce the frequency with which you have to manage your inventory. There's a sense of bloat that permeates many of Hogwarts Legacy's mechanics, informing design decisions that turn it into a familiar loot-based action game. There are so many systems that exist solely to tempt you into caring about maxing out your equipment levels or upgrading gear to enhance its stats, both of which are completely unnecessary in the face of how little a challenge the combat poses to keep up with you. The Room of Requirement, a small hub of sorts, is a space that lets you reveal unidentified gear, similar to Diablo or Destiny, craft potions and cultivate violent flora that both feature long timers you have to wait on before you can claim them, and a massive space for all your collected beasts that can be farmed for resources vital to upgrading your gear. Aside from the odd visit to complete a quest or craft a single potion, I felt little reason to return to this space for the many purposes it was designed for. Even unidentified gear became mostly irrelevant, as better gear (often in the same rarity class) would drop before I felt compelled to make the trip. These are some of the numerous systems that Hogwarts Legacy pushes you to engage with, often forcibly through questlines, with many of them not coalescing with the structure of the rest of the game, ending up as superfluous and a waste of time. Time is something Hogwarts Legacy and its repetitive quests, dull open world, and monotonous combat often do not respect, from its slow opening to its insistence on introducing new systems to juggle just for the sake of it. It's a bit of a shame that these parts couldn't coalesce in the same way that its presentation and respect for its universe does, because Hogwarts Castle persists as a delightful puzzle box to explore from the moment you step foot in its doors to the last day of term. There's equally delightful moments during some of the main quests, specifically those that balance puzzle-solving and combat in ways that challenge your understanding of the spells you have in engaging ways. But these moments are so spread out between much less interesting filler content that it will likely take some of the most dedicated Harry Potter fans to justify seeing the entire journey through.","length":18940,"tokens":3915,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"Hogwarts Legacy is developed by Avalanche Software, a subsidiary of Warner Bros.

For many it was a property that grew up with them, with both the book and film series persisting in the zeitgeist for decades.

Its adaptation of this universe is undeniably the most extensive yet, allowing you to truly explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas like never before. But it's also stuck too keenly in the present (and sometimes, past) of open-world game design, reducing much of what you do to repetitive checklist activities in a world that is disappointingly barren. Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the late 1800s, although you might be hard-pressed to notice that from the way characters speak or by the clothes they wear, which look ripped straight out of the films set in the late 1900s. You play as a prodigal witch or wizard of your own creation, this time fighting against a goblin uprising led by one particularly nasty one named Ranrok. This props up a predictable and surprisingly sporadic narrative, with main beats and progression only taking place every few hours as you complete the requisite quests around them, which are often barely related. There's so little screen time for many of the main characters that you struggle to get a sense of their motives, especially so in the case of Ranrok, who only appears to deliver a line or two to some subordinates before he disappears for a couple of hours. It robs him, and the story, of any sense of emotional tension, reducing it to nothing more than \"talented good student takes out bad powerful goblin\" by the end.","content_length":1418,"content_tokens":289,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The initial introduction to each class is captivating, from partaking in duels in Defence Against the Dark Arts or being subjected to a screaming Mandrake in Herbology. These are some of the moments where Hogwarts Legacy is at its strongest, recapturing the sense of wonder that has made this world so enticing to so many. The mechanical components of each class, however, fall woefully short. The small minigame used to convey wand movements for each spell feels ripped out of the series' very first video game entry nearly two decades ago, while many of the activities introduced shortly after are brief, uninteresting, and usually used as a means to fill your map with many more instances of the same thing.","content_length":916,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"They quickly extinguish any glimmers of hope that the school aspect to your time at Hogwarts will be as engaging as many of these classes might seem from the outside. After your introduction to each class, your engagement with each professor and their craft is relegated to even less interesting quests. You're tasked with completing two objectives before they'll dole out another spell, with the chores in question sometimes not even making sense for the class they're required for. Some you'll end up completing naturally as you explore or engage with other quests, such as those that require you to use certain spells on enemies or acquire particular potions. Others will, however, routinely force you to deviate from the fun, such as objectives that ask you to either purchase or grow a particular plant in the Room of Requirement (which can take upwards of 15 real-world minutes, not too unlike the artificial timers you'd find in a free mobile game)","content_length":955,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"It was confusing to have progression routinely stifled by these activities, given that most main quests generally required a certain spell before they could be started. This growing collection of spells is most useful in Hogwarts Legacy's combat, which initially makes a strong impression. Basic attack and protection spells can be fired off with ease, with the combat flow mimicking a familiar setup of timing blocks and parries as you mash away at the attack button in-between. Advanced spells sit on a four-slot weapon wheel, allowing you to cast them using one of the four face buttons. They're filtered into red, yellow, and purple classes, each of which informs you of their overall purpose in battle.

Flinging a foe into the air, firing off some basic attacks and then suspending them there even further makes you feel incredibly powerful, but it's also an effective way to take down enemies that are happy enough to soak up damage from your basic attack. This way of using magic is foreign to how it's portrayed in the rest of Potterverse media, but it rarely feels out of place here. There can be some narrative dissonance if you ponder on it too long--why are professors at Hogwarts so comfortable with students fighting thousands of dangerous goblins and dark wizards and witches just off school grounds, for example–but it's easy enough to suspend disbelief for the sake of the satisfaction of getting to wield magic so freely.

As you continue obtaining more spells, you're forced to assign them to alternative loadouts, with a maximum of four once you've unlocked them all. The way you swap between each of these loadouts, and in turn reassign which face buttons are assigned to each spell, is incredibly cumbersome.

Larger enemies are immune to the sort of juggling you might have become comfortable employing on smaller hapless foes, but they diminish any additional sense of danger they could've presented by featuring a grossly limited moveset for attacks. This is even worse with bosses, especially those repeated at the end of several key story missions, who only have two attack patterns you need to learn as you slowly chip away at their health bar. The repetitive nature of these fights makes you keenly aware of how they're artificially drawn out, sapping any real excitement from most of them. Almost every quest incorporates combat in some way, which doesn't help its repetitive nature, but many also give you chances to use spells in less obvious ways.","content_length":993,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"With your assortment of manipulative magic, Hogwarts Legacy trusts your intelligence with spatial puzzles that sometimes had me pausing for thought before arriving at a satisfying solution. The best quests were ones that mixed this up nicely with combat, peppering a multi-staged level filled with puzzles with some brief fights to shake up the pacing. Perhaps the best example of this is an assault on Falbarton Castle, which featured a variety of high walls to scale with combinations of levitation and time-freezing spells, along with smart combat encounters in uncharacteristically tight spaces where a small misstep could be a long fall to death. It's capped off with a suitably climactic scene where you take flight atop a Hippogriff for the first time; it swoops down a nearby valley just as the Hogwarts Express is traveling past, throwing up thick clouds of smoke as it passes by.","content_length":889,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:47PM PST","content":"It's a quintessentially Harry Potter moment that feels ripped out of the main canon, and emphasizes the attention to detail that Hogwarts Legacy abides by in this regard. This attention to detail is most evident throughout Hogwarts Castle, far and away the most engaging area of Hogwart Legacy's expansive open-world. If you've ever tried to piece together exactly how all of its rooms connect, how staircases that move around join vital hallways together, or just where every little landmark is situated, there hasn't been a better way to get those answers to date. At times it feels like you're navigating an engrossing museum, taking small stops at places of magnificence such as The Great Hall or The Library, seeing students going about their day and small acts of playful magic firing off in the corner of your eye.

While Hogwarts Castle is grandiose, the only other part of Hogwarts Legacy's gigantic map that comes close to matching it is the vendor-laden streets of Hogsmeade. Ignoring the same two vocal cues that played every time I ventured there, the town itself is every bit as cozy as your character will frequently suggest, while also providing vital mercantile services for all your potions, equipment, and more. The areas surrounding both of these large landmarks are disappointingly barren by comparison.

Nothing makes this more evident than when you're flying across the countryside on a mount or broom. While it's unsurprisingly easy to pick out both Hogwarts and Hogsmeade from a distance, everything else blends into an indistinguishable blur of forestry and bare fields, which rarely invited me to explore it over fast-traveling between quests. To be clear, there are things to do within this visually drab open world, but they're usually just as uninteresting as their backdrop.

Problems arise, however, when Hogwarts Legacy forces you to engage with these mediocre side activities in order to progress. Many story quests are gated with both level and spell requirements, the former depending on your current numerical level and the latter on whether or not you have access to a specific spell.

Aside from the odd visit to complete a quest or craft a single potion, I felt little reason to return to this space for the many purposes it was designed for. Even unidentified gear became mostly irrelevant, as better gear (often in the same rarity class) would drop before I felt compelled to make the trip.

There's equally delightful moments during some of the main quests, specifically those that balance puzzle-solving and combat in ways that challenge your understanding of the spells you have in engaging ways.

The game begins in a city in the clouds, features reality-bending and elemental powers you can employ in your fight against advanced robots, sees you scrounging for resources in an idyllic city that's falling apart, and stars an amnesiac protagonist grappling with the nuances of free will. By the time you reach the climax of the story and you're asked to visit a lighthouse, you know what's up. Where Atomic Heart most differs from its inspiration is in the lens through which it focuses its narrative, exploring concepts of free will via Soviet Russian collectivism instead of the U. S.' individualism. However, its intriguing premise is let down by a deeply unlikable protagonist and a predictable storyline that doesn't do anything interesting with its cool ideas. In the alternate history of Atomic Heart, a scientist named Dmitry Sechenov kickstarts a robotics boom in Russia in the 1930s. By the 1950s, the working class has been abolished in the Soviet Union and completely replaced by robots controlled through a hive-mind network called Kollectiv 1.0. The game begins a few years after that, just prior to the public unveiling of Kollectiv 2.0, which will allow all humans to have equal access to the hive-mind to control robots remotely through a Thought device wired straight to their brain, as well as connect and share information with each other across great distances.

Assigned to investigate a disturbance in Facility 3826, the Soviet Union's foremost scientific research hub, Sergei is joined by Charles, a sentient glove that gifts the agent with a host of polymer-fed technopowers like telekinesis and cryokinesis, and provides a sounding board for Sergei's oftentimes annoying and borderline abusive collection of quips and unfunny comebacks. Within the now blood-soaked hallways and flickering lights of the partially destroyed underground facility, Sergei discovers experiments into mutation gone awry and finds that the once-peaceful robot assistants have turned blood-thirsty. The true horror doesn't come until later, however, when Charles talks to Sergei about the ways in which Kollectiv 2.0 (which is already installed into Sergei) may not be entirely beneficial. Hasn't Sergei noticed that all those audio logs he's found and computers he's logged into only give him information that's relevant to furthering the mission he's been assigned? Wow, it's almost as if an algorithm is feeding him with information about what it thinks he should see and hear more of, disguising it in a way where he can't spot the manipulation. It's not as overt a form of control as a spoken command but Charles hints that humans can be directed just as easily as robots once they've all logged into the same hive-mind of information, especially if there is a way to control that information. It's an intriguing concept, one furthered by the notion that Atomic Heart is a video game and so we, the player, have been directing Sergei's actions the entire time. So it's not just Sergei who's being manipulated to view the game's world in a certain way based on a fictional Internet algorithm, it's us too. But as interesting as it is, exploring free will through the scope of a video game's story has been done before, and Atomic Heart doesn't do anything notably novel with the concept. In fact, its protagonist actively gets in the way of this concept being explored, raging at Charles that he doesn't have time to wax poetic about hypotheticals. He can't be bothered to offer any sort of introspection because there are robots that need to be stopped and a bad guy to blame that needs killing. Over and over, Charles brings up the morality of their mission and the larger implications of what's going on, and repeatedly Sergei just doesn't care, citing that he'll leave the thinking to Sechenov. The first and second times it happens, you're hopeful that this flaw is setting up some form of character development for Sergei. When you're 10 hours in and Sergei is still spinning in the same pattern and showing no signs of growing as a person, you can't help but wonder how anyone could be this stubbornly bone-headed and annoyingly naive. Sergei is also deeply unlikable as a person. He's antagonistic to everyone around him, including the regularly helpful Charles, and it's never explained why, leading to the slow realization of the painful truth that you're just playing as a shitty human being. You don't feel good playing as Sergei whenever he opens his mouth to talk to anyone--I empathize more with the people who have to tolerate his barrage of unfunny insults than I do him. It's familiar but still fun. Despite being a jerk, he does know how to fight. Wielding polymer abilities with his left hand and an assortment of firearms and weapons with his right, Sergei is a hard-hitting fighter. While the robots and mutants he goes up against are far faster than he is, you can easily escape the swarms by using Sergei's dash to reposition, curating a frenetic hit-and-run combat experience. Though relatively simple at first, combat evolves into a more engaging experience as more enemy types are introduced, each with its own attack patterns and weaknesses. Atomic Heart has a healthy diversity of enemy types. However, there's nothing you'll face you probably haven't fought a variation of before in other games--ranging from dog-like enemies that try to circle you before pouncing in your direction to turret-like adversaries that shoot at you from afar to bulky foes who heavily telegraph their attacks but can take a hit. The same goes for the weapons and powers you use to fight them. The pump-action shotgun hits like you'd expect a shotgun should, for instance, and the cold polymer power freezes enemies in their tracks just as you'd assume. There's nothing revolutionary to how combat plays out, but it all works as it should. It's familiar but still fun. Looting is surprisingly the most enjoyable aspect of Atomic Heart, as, with just the click of a button, Charles can use telekinesis to pull loot into Sergei's pocket. In practice, this causes drawers to fly open, cabinet doors to almost swing off their hinges, and the bodies of enemies to erupt as the magnetic pull of Charles rips the resources of a room towards Sergei. It never got old to enter an unexplored room or clear out a group of enemies and then sit back to watch as everything around me exploded into a whirlwind of paper and scraps of metal, sucked into my coffers like a greedy tornado. Of course, you can then use these resources to craft new firearms, ammo, weapon attachments, and items, but the sheer delight of the act is almost enough of a reward in itself. The twins, Right and Left, deserved to have more screentime. After completing the first mission, Sergei takes a monorail to the main area of the game, where Atomic Heart expands into an open-world format. At this point, the game's narrative slows to an annoying crawl as Sergei journeys to one of several facilities to complete a mission, return to the surface of the open world, travel to the next facility, and repeat the process. Even if you don't take the time to freely explore the map, complete optional challenges, and look for materials to unlock special attachments for your firearms, the journey between waypoints still bogs down the story. Nothing of narrative importance happens outside of the contained, linear levels of the different facilities, and combat benefits from the carefully structured layout of those contained levels. Even enemy placement and type are curated to fit specific areas of the linear levels, and that careful curation is lost within the breadth of the open world. I would often just hop in a car and drive straight to the next story beat, as that's where the better gameplay is. It makes the open world feel superfluous, adding content at the expense of enjoyability. Fortunately, some of the main levels have a distinct flavor and engaging themes to them, helping them to stand out against the largely forgettable open world. My favorite of these levels takes place in a theater known for being the first to feature a cast composed entirely of robots. The level sees Sergei chasing after a man who used to work there, who has twisted the theater into a macabre showcase of art--much like in BioShock. There's this breadcrumb trail of diary entries you can uncover that reveals an engineer coming to terms with the strange parasocial relationship he's developing with one of the robot dancers, a clever puzzle that incorporates ballet poses and blood splatters, and an incredible moment where you're fighting off waves of enemies during a ballet that gets a hip-hop remixIt's a great level, and I'm sad we didn't get more like it or at least have more examples of using music to transform a familiar combat scenario into something more memorable. Atomic Heart has a great soundtrack filled with thumping, high-energy music from Doom composer Mick Gordon that will get your head bobbing during even the most butt-clenching of battles. But these powerful rhythms are usually reserved for boss encounters, meaning a lot of the game's best music is fleeting and only pops up for one encounter before never being heard from again. That moment in the theater is cool, but it's the only time something like that happens in the game. Atomic Heart doesn't build on it to make more moments like it--in fact, there are quite a few instances where the powerful soundtrack feels wasted because the superb composition that's playing doesn't match the vibe of what you're currently doing. Why play hard rock during a stressful fight in the dimly lit space of a morgue? It just doesn't fit. There are quite a few parts of Atomic Heart that just don't neatly fit together, and those disparities create an experience that often feels at odds with itself. That disparity is most evident in how the history of the world in Atomic Heart is interesting and sets up an intriguing conversation about the nature of free will and collectivism, but then the unlikable protagonist repeatedly prevents that topic from being explored. Atomic Heart is certainly going to appeal to some people, especially those looking to relive BioShock Infinite, but it's not an easy recommendation.","length":12654,"tokens":2739,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Atomic Heart Review - Crispy Critters","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-crispy-critters/1900-6418033/","post_date":"February 20, 2023 at 4:42PM PST","content":"Atomic Heart doesn't hide its BioShock Infinite inspirations. The game begins in a city in the clouds, features reality-bending and elemental powers you can employ in your fight against advanced robots, sees you scrounging for resources in an idyllic city that's falling apart, and stars an amnesiac protagonist grappling with the nuances of free will. By the time you reach the climax of the story and you're asked to visit a lighthouse, you know what's up. Where Atomic Heart most differs from its inspiration is in the lens through which it focuses its narrative, exploring concepts of free will via Soviet Russian collectivism instead of the U. S.' individualism. However, its intriguing premise is let down by a deeply unlikable protagonist and a predictable storyline that doesn't do anything interesting with its cool ideas.

Within the now blood-soaked hallways and flickering lights of the partially destroyed underground facility, Sergei discovers experiments into mutation gone awry and finds that the once-peaceful robot assistants have turned blood-thirsty.

The result is Like A Dragon: Ishin, an enticing period piece that also includes the series' action-brawler gameplay and ridiculous hijinx. Even though the context has changed, swapping the gangs of the modern criminal underworld for political factions in a tumultuous time in history, Ishin is yet another example of what developer RGG Studio does best: melodramatic storytelling. It's been a long time coming as Yakuza: Ishin, originally a PS3/PS4 game from 2014, was not previously localized and brought to the West like other entries in the franchise. This new version lands somewhere between a remaster and remake, but it is based on older iterations of Yakuza games which makes Like A Dragon: Ishin feel dated in several respects, particularly in moment-to-moment gameplay. Still, its fundamentals are solid and the main draws of the franchise remain intact, hooking me with its characters and twists that had me eager to see its historical fiction unfold from chapter to chapter. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

In the same way previous Yakuza games offer a sort of virtual tourism, Ishin's vivid reconstruction of Japan's past (albeit with more creative liberties) delivers the same thrills. The streets are filled with menacing men wanting to cut you down as you mind your business strolling through the markets, restaurants and bars represent the era's cuisine, and tons of side content reflect the culture and traditions of the time. While it may not be as dazzling as the neon-lit streets of the modern day, the more low-key setting of Kyo (which is now modern-day Kyoto) is refreshing and a welcome change of pace that lets the Yakuza formula thrive once again within a framework it is comfortable with. What you really come to this series for is the drama, and the Bakumatsu period of the Edo era is fertile ground for Ishin's historical fiction. It's a time in Japanese history when internal conflict and political strife came to a head, with various factions vying for power, leading to a transitional phase for the country. Ishin uses this as a stage to tell another story of betrayal, conflicting ideals, and seeking personal truths, but fits it into a pivotal time of widespread violence and societal turbulence. Ishin melds these parallel themes gracefully using strong characters as the focal point for both the gripping personal drama and the escalating struggle for power to steer Japan's future. By using the same character models and voice actors from the Yakuza pantheon, Ishin creates an immediate familiarity that made me feel right at home but ever-curious about the direction of its story. Series legend Kazuma Kiryu takes on the role of Ishin's protagonist Ryoma Sakamoto / Hajima Saito (as an alias), loosely based on the revered real-world figures of the same names. Other favorites like Majima, Saejima, and Akiyama fill in the roles of Soji Okita, Shinpachi Nagakura, and Katsura Kogoro, respectively--just to name a few. It's wild to see such an all-star cast don the names and roles of historical figures, but what's more striking is that each character remains true to their ethos and personality from the mainline games. Although no experience with the Yakuza series is required to understand or enjoy Ishin, the little nods and references in dialogue, visual flourishes, and musical themes along the way are real treats for Yakuza sickos such as myself. The dynamics between each character make for some hype moments and thrilling battles, especially with its prestige-level cutscenes that perfectly frame the story's pivotal moments. Facial close-ups where you can see every little expression and the elegantly choreographed duels sell you on the emotion established in each cutscene, making the melodrama feel earnest, as the series always does. I was drawn to each character as if I needed no introduction, like seeing old pals and rivals from a movie screen fit right into a stage play. However, Ishin does take its time to get the ball rolling. It wasn't until roughly 8 hours in, around the halfway point, that I started to see the various pieces fall into place and the story comes into clearer focus. It drops a lot on you, frontloading the story by establishing factions, political terminology, and the deep cast in a way that can be tough to follow if you're not already familiar with Edo period history. Ishin is ambitious in that way, trusting that you can keep up and track the things it throws at you. But at the same time, the first half sort of spins its wheels before having real consequences and character motivations take center stage. Once the tangled web of alliances started to carry more narrative weight, however, it was hard to put down as the momentum of the drama propelled me to the end, leaving me eager to find out what happens in each subsequent chapter. I've played too many of these games to be completely surprised by their plot twists at this point, but time after time, Yakuza games still activate those good brain chemicals with their cinematic storytelling panache, and Ishin is no exception. Like a Dragon: IshinGallery Whether it be the Bakufu, Shinsengumi, Tosa Loyalist Party, or the various schemers looking to get a leg up in the upper classes, these organizations are focused on seizing power and enacting their brand of order in society. The story opens up by showing you firsthand the ugliness of the feudalistic caste system in place at the time, motivating you to fight the power, but as Ishin shows, virtue is in short supply no matter where you look. There are some patriotic platitudes sprinkled throughout for dramatic effect and to show a seemingly genuine desire for what's best for one's country, especially in the face of persistent meddling by deceptive western powers, but it keeps the romanticization of honor and glorification of samurai at arm's length, unlike popular stories that have reveled in those myths. And as history has shown, the Meiji era of imperialism and nationalism that soon followed the period Ishin takes place in had a brutal and destructive impact. So while the political backdrop is fascinating and critical to the entirety of Ishin, it pretty much sticks to familiar beats of mainline Yakuza games to show that in its ugly history, there aren't really any \"good guys.\"Ishin's tried-and-true action-brawler combat serves as a sufficient vehicle for all the gripping drama and larger-than-life characters. It's similar to the Yakuza games of old but with a focus on swordsmanship and firearms. The four fighting styles feel more distinct than the various stances from previous Yakuza brawlers and have their own advantages in certain combat situations. I can elegantly slice through a crowd of enemies with the nimble Wild Dancer that combines sword and handgun, then switch to the deft-handed Swordsman stance to lay on heavy damage in one-on-one battles. The grappling-based Brawler, meanwhile, can be used for brute force and the Gunman can chip away at enemies from a distance, which helps mix things up. A flexible upgrade system rewards you for using different stances and lets you add perks like new, devastating Heat Actions--the series' signature cinematic finishers--or extended combos as you level up. Dojos throughout Kyo have their own little stories and unlock more options to get the most out of your stances and Trooper Cards act as special abilities that either provide buffs or magic-like attacks that somehow fit the ridiculousness I've come to love about the series. Ishin can be as technical as you want it to be, even though basic hacking and slashing can get you through most of the story's battles well enough. Like other entries, you'll fight through hordes of enemies in story-driven scenarios, and they tend to have a bag of cheap tricks in their back pockets that are inoffensive at best and annoying at worst. On the other hand, Ishin's boss fights are a highlight, which feel less like a war of attrition and more like a duel between skilled swordsmen. And these battles are topped off with over-the-top theatrics--in true series fashion, I can stab a dude in the gut five times and fire 10 shots point-blank, but when the dust settles, those gruesome Heat Actions were just a bloodless way to settle the score. This new version of Ishin is faithful to what the original was when it came out in 2014 and uses an identical gameplay foundation from the older series entries. So, while it's rebuilt on Unreal Engine 4, it plays much like Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami. However, that's a noticeable step back after five other entries in the modernized Dragon Engine--especially coming off the latest in Lost Judgment, which featured the best brawler combat system RGG has made thus far. Playing through Ishin, it's clear how much the series has evolved, with better fluidity of movement, and how that manifests in a more robust combat experience. Even though I can enjoy it for what it is, I had to place the game in context and keep my expectations in check. The older tech shows its age in other aspects, as it's apparent with quality-of-life features seen in later entries just aren't present here. With the Dragon Engine having flexed the seamlessness of walking into the various shops and establishments, the segmented design of the open world reminds you that this is a game of generations past. Like a Dragon: IshinGallery The actual content of the various activities that fill the streets of Kyo, however, are as good as they've always been. Signatures like rhythm-based karaoke feature a playlist of bangers that has Ryoma on stage singing his heart out to a crowd of bar patrons--good old \"Baka Mitai\" gets another goofy rendition here, and finally, I get to play through the original folksy version of \"Iji Sakura,\" which grabs you with a catchy, somber melody and voice actor Takaya Kuroda's deep tones. And as someone who loves rhythm games, the fan dancing minigame and substory had me sinking even more time in chaining combos to some catchy Japanese folk tunes as Ryoma showcases his elegant traditional moves. I sunk the most time into farming, fishing, and cooking, which all feed into the side content dubbed Another Life. Here, Ryoma lives off the land as you manage crops to grow in the backyard of his own home. As you harvest fruits and veggies, and reel in more fish from the rivers and open seas, you can cook more dishes. Cooking is done through cute little minigames that reward you with food as powerful healing items and extra money if you want to fulfill food delivery requests. It's also how you connect with Ryoma's adoptive daughter Haruka, who is essentially the same character as in the mainline games. As with any Yakuza game, substories litter the streets as either short diversions for silly side stories with absurd or heartwarming moments. You'll be doing a logic exercise to correctly accuse the culprits who stole a coworker's mochi, helping a kid repair a relationship with a friend who's moving away, slicing up dudes to protect some escaping an arranged marriage, and many other bizarre or amusing divergences--this version of Ryoma Sakamoto gets comically roped into everybody's business and is just as naive but good-natured as the Kiryu we've grown to love. There are a ton of these substories as well, which can be overbearing when they automatically trigger and interrupt the main story's momentum. And while not every one of these substories is worth writing home about, they're always welcome as a reason to keep playing and experience the ever-present goofy side of RGG games. Like A Dragon: Ishin is a fascinating part of the RGG Studio catalog, creatively blending the characters and drama we know and love across the Yakuza lore with a period piece set during a turbulent time in Japanese history. By virtue of its brand of storytelling, Ishin forgoes some of the tropes that have glorified samurai but rides that line ever so closely. If the series is one thing, it's consistent--because despite the shift to Edo-era Japan, there's an unmistakable familiarity. The days of asking Sega to bring Ishin to the West are thankfully over. And although this revision uses an older foundation that shows its age, it's nice to finally have a version of the game that has been tidied up for modern platforms. Like a Dragon: Ishin brings an all-star cast back together for a story that's bigger than any one character, and it makes for a fine addition to the series’ deep history.","length":14708,"tokens":3249,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/","post_date":"February 17, 2023 at 7:00AM PST","content":"Take the faces, voices, and over-the-top theatrics that have made the Yakuza franchise renowned, and transport all that back to 19th century Japan. The result is Like A Dragon: Ishin, an enticing period piece that also includes the series' action-brawler gameplay and ridiculous hijinx. Even though the context has changed, swapping the gangs of the modern criminal underworld for political factions in a tumultuous time in history, Ishin is yet another example of what developer RGG Studio does best: melodramatic storytelling. It's been a long time coming as Yakuza: Ishin, originally a PS3/PS4 game from 2014, was not previously localized and brought to the West like other entries in the franchise. This new version lands somewhere between a remaster and remake, but it is based on older iterations of Yakuza games which makes Like A Dragon: Ishin feel dated in several respects, particularly in moment-to-moment gameplay. Still, its fundamentals are solid and the main draws of the franchise remain intact, hooking me with its characters and twists that had me eager to see its historical fiction unfold from chapter to chapter.","content_length":1132,"content_tokens":240,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/","post_date":"February 17, 2023 at 7:00AM PST","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

The streets are filled with menacing men wanting to cut you down as you mind your business strolling through the markets, restaurants and bars represent the era's cuisine, and tons of side content reflect the culture and traditions of the time. While it may not be as dazzling as the neon-lit streets of the modern day, the more low-key setting of Kyo (which is now modern-day Kyoto) is refreshing and a welcome change of pace that lets the Yakuza formula thrive once again within a framework it is comfortable with. What you really come to this series for is the drama, and the Bakumatsu period of the Edo era is fertile ground for Ishin's historical fiction.","content_length":841,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/","post_date":"February 17, 2023 at 7:00AM PST","content":"It's a time in Japanese history when internal conflict and political strife came to a head, with various factions vying for power, leading to a transitional phase for the country. Ishin uses this as a stage to tell another story of betrayal, conflicting ideals, and seeking personal truths, but fits it into a pivotal time of widespread violence and societal turbulence. Ishin melds these parallel themes gracefully using strong characters as the focal point for both the gripping personal drama and the escalating struggle for power to steer Japan's future. By using the same character models and voice actors from the Yakuza pantheon, Ishin creates an immediate familiarity that made me feel right at home but ever-curious about the direction of its story. Series legend Kazuma Kiryu takes on the role of Ishin's protagonist Ryoma Sakamoto / Hajima Saito (as an alias), loosely based on the revered real-world figures of the same names.","content_length":938,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/","post_date":"February 17, 2023 at 7:00AM PST","content":"Other favorites like Majima, Saejima, and Akiyama fill in the roles of Soji Okita, Shinpachi Nagakura, and Katsura Kogoro, respectively--just to name a few. It's wild to see such an all-star cast don the names and roles of historical figures, but what's more striking is that each character remains true to their ethos and personality from the mainline games. Although no experience with the Yakuza series is required to understand or enjoy Ishin, the little nods and references in dialogue, visual flourishes, and musical themes along the way are real treats for Yakuza sickos such as myself. The dynamics between each character make for some hype moments and thrilling battles, especially with its prestige-level cutscenes that perfectly frame the story's pivotal moments.","content_length":774,"content_tokens":167,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/","post_date":"February 17, 2023 at 7:00AM PST","content":"Facial close-ups where you can see every little expression and the elegantly choreographed duels sell you on the emotion established in each cutscene, making the melodrama feel earnest, as the series always does.

Both games are about exploring large, open areas--either alone or with other players--to find and defeat giant monsters, then harvesting and using their parts to craft better weapons and armor. Developer Omega Force has explored the genre before with the Toukiden series, and those two games represent perhaps the best examples of the monster-hunting genre outside of Capcom's own influential best-sellers. With Wild Hearts, Omega Force hasn't just set out to create a simple imitation, though. Sure, it has plenty of familiar elements, but the novel Karakuri system gives the game a unique identity that sets it apart from its contemporaries. In the fiction of Wild Hearts, Karakuri is an ancient technology used by hunters to conjure impressive pieces of technology out of thin air. In action, it's a fast-paced crafting system that serves multiple functions, opening up your available options both in and out of combat. You start with what are known as Basic Karakuri, the first of which lets you produce a wooden crate that launches you into the air when you climb on top of it. You can stack up to three of these crates at once to generate extra height, which proves useful when exploring the environment but really comes into its own when fighting Wild Hearts' various monsters, known as Kemono. You can launch from these crates and transition into a devastating downward strike, or utilize the added elevation to quickly avoid an area-of-effect attack that spews out a pool of lava or poisonous clouds. Most Karakuri serve a dual purpose such as this, whether it's a springboard that proves useful in dodging attacks and propelling you toward Kemono, or a glider that allows you to traverse large gaps and position yourself above monsters for an aerial barrage. <p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

Constructing a crate, springboard, or torch in the heat of battle eventually becomes second nature, and being able to do so is just as essential to each battle as knowing how to use your specific weapon of choice. Later on, you also unlock various Fusion Karakuri, which use different combinations of Basic Karakuri to create larger, more elaborate contraptions. Stacking nine crates together in three rows, for instance, produces a rock-solid wall that can block incoming projectiles or halt a charging Kemono in its tracks, launching the beast into the air before leaving it in a vulnerable heap on the ground. You can also summon gigantic bouncing hammers, powerful bombs, and blinding firework cannons that can knock flying enemies out of the sky. There's something immensely satisfying about creating an apparatus out of thin air and using it to gain an advantage over a 20-foot-tall monster, yet the presence of these multifaceted tools doesn't dilute the tension that's inherent to the genre. Each one costs a specific resource to build called Celestial Thread. If you run out, you can find more by hacking down trees and rocks, or by extracting chunks of it by targeting weak spots on a Kemono's body. This ensures that you need to think strategically and consider when and how to use Karakuri, but it also offers extra encouragement to play with other people because you can pool all of your individual resources together. You might build a wall to protect a teammate who's stunned, all leap from the same structure to deliver three consecutive aerial attacks, or help someone finish building a mechanism after they've run out of Celestial Thread. There are numerous ways to play cooperatively and it's a fairly simple process, whether you're aiming to party up with friends or join a couple of strangers. You can search for other sessions that are tackling specific hunts, join a fellow hunter in need, ask for assistance yourself, or create your own party, and the inclusion of cross-play also makes it that much easier to group up with others. You have the opportunity to revive each other, too, which makes Wild Hearts' multiplayer more approachable than Monster Hunter's. Everyone still shares the same pool of three lives, but you're less likely to die if someone else is around to help you back up. You can play the entirety of Wild Hearts solo, but there are a few drastic difficulty spikes that make this a perilous proposition. The first roadblock is a Kemono ominously called Deathstalker. After failing to put a dent in it on more than a few occasions, I spent a couple of hours hunting other monsters so I could improve my gear and focus on its elemental strengths and weaknesses. Equipped with the best ice-resistant armor I could craft, and the best fire-tinged weapon at my disposal, it still took me a few tries to eventually defeat the beast. I imagine this would have been easier if I could enlist the help of other hunters, but this proved impossible on this particular hunt prior to launch, so I was stuck by myself. If you're averse to playing with others, this sudden difficulty spike may prove too much, so it's tough to recommend Wild Hearts to those who prefer to play alone. Playing cooperatively is also just a better experience, partly because there's more of a communal spirit than in other monster-hunting games. Wild HeartsGallery Both Basic and Fusion Karakuri are liable to break when met with the full force of a Kemono, but there are a plethora of Dragon Karakuri that persist throughout the entire game unless you opt to dismantle them yourself. Instead of using Celestial Thread, these constructions pull from Dragon Pits that are located on each of the game's four islands. By unlocking them, you can use their resources to materialize bigger tools like zip lines, wind vortexes, and giant wheels you can clamber inside and drive. Placing these traversal tools in your world makes subsequent hunts faster, but you can also place them in other players' sessions, and they can do so in yours. Even if you're not playing with someone else at that exact moment, something they built previously might still leave a mark on your hunt, aiding your success long after they've departed. The moment-to-moment impact of Wild Hearts' Karakuri mechanic is already terrific, but adding a societal value to some of the constructions elevates it even further. When you're not building magical gizmos to assist you on the hunt, you're wielding one of eight distinct weapon types to deal damage. These deadly accouterments range from a nimble katana to a hefty maul and a robust hand cannon, and each one has its own idiosyncrasies, including unique weapon gauges that allow you to inflict heavy damage when a certain requirement has been met. By attacking and performing combos with the katana, for example, a gauge fills up that, when full, lets you trigger Unbound mode, transforming the sword into a bladed whip that deals additional damage for a short period of time. Elsewhere, the Karakuri Staff can mutate between five different forms: a staff, polearm, shuriken, double blades, and the building-sized juggernaut blade, while the Bladed Wagasa is an umbrella with an emphasis on counter-attacks and airborne moves. Most of these weapons are rather straightforward--with a couple of exceptions--but any lack of depth is alleviated by how they synergize with the various Karakuri. The slow, lumbering Nodachi's lack of mobility isn't as much of a problem when you can use springs to quickly maneuver around a Kemono, just as crates and gliders give you ample opportunity to unleash the katana's powerful jumping attacks. Karakuri feels like an extension of each weapon, offering additional offense, defense, and mobility. Crafting the starting version of each weapon type is also relatively cheap, and there's a training area that explains how to perform each attack and special move, so Wild Hearts makes it easy to experiment, learn, and decide which killing tool is right for you. The weapon upgrade tree is fairly restrictive, however, making you fight the same low-level monsters over and over again before you can craft some of the more powerful armaments. Whatever weapon you choose, Wild Hearts' action is thrilling if familiar. There's a palpable sense of weight behind each weapon swing, and you need to consider when to attack so you're not locked into an animation when you're forced to roll out of danger. Slicing off monster parts is always gratifying, and the orchestral score conveys a sense of wonder and terror in equal measure, often evoking classic Japanese cinema with its use of traditional instruments which contributes to each battle's awe-inspiring nature. There's also a lock-on system that makes it easier to target specific body parts, but it has trouble keeping up with the action, often blocking your view with the floor or other nearby objects, so it's more frustrating than anything. Wild HeartsGallery Of course, the Kemono themselves play a pivotal role in how enjoyable it is to cut them down to size. Each one is a giant, mutated version of familiar wildlife, from rats and boars to gorillas and crows. Crucially, these rampaging beasts are also fused with nature, able to strike at you with fetid fungus spores and twisting roots that violently emerge from the ground. Each Kemono presents a different challenge, and learning the best strategies to take them down is a rewarding experience that encourages the full use of your extensive repertoire. The monster designs are solid from a visual point of view, but this isn't commonplace across the rest of the game. Wild Hearts is set in the fictional land of Azuma, which is inspired by feudal Japan. Each location has a distinct flavor, oscillating between the verdant rolling hills of Harugasumi Way, the craggy barnacle-encrusted beaches of Natsukodachi Isle, and the once-impenetrable Fuyufusagi Fort, which now lies in ruin amidst a neverending winter. There are some beautiful sights to behold, but also plenty of others that fail to flatter due to the abundance of low-resolution textures and a general blurriness. I mention this because, despite appearances, Wild Hearts also struggles when it comes to performance. My PC setup exceeds the recommended system requirements, yet stuttering and frame rate issues were a nuisance throughout my playtime. Thankfully, these hitches didn't occur quite as often during combat, but I still encountered a few moments where the game would freeze for a few seconds at a time. Lowering the graphical settings didn't alleviate these technical shortcomings either, since it still performed the same at both the lowest and highest presets. A couple of updates have already yielded minor improvements, and Omega Force says more fixes are on the way, so the hope is these issues will soon be a thing of the past. The core gameplay loop of Wild Hearts doesn't deviate too far from the formula established by Monster Hunter, yet the surprising decision to center it all around a fast-paced building mechanic is a stroke of ingenuity. The Karakuri system elevates each individual part of Wild Hearts. Combat, traversal, and co-op are all improved by its presence and the way Karakuri is weaved into each component. There are some notable shortcomings that hold it back, especially when it comes to technical performance, but Wild Hearts is a welcome entry in a genre that's otherwise dominated by a single series.","length":13441,"tokens":2916,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Wild Hearts Review - Build Me Up","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/","post_date":"February 16, 2023 at 7:45AM PST","content":"You only need to glance at Wild Hearts for a moment to see the similarities it shares with Capcom's Monster Hunter series. Both games are about exploring large, open areas--either alone or with other players--to find and defeat giant monsters, then harvesting and using their parts to craft better weapons and armor. Developer Omega Force has explored the genre before with the Toukiden series, and those two games represent perhaps the best examples of the monster-hunting genre outside of Capcom's own influential best-sellers. With Wild Hearts, Omega Force hasn't just set out to create a simple imitation, though. Sure, it has plenty of familiar elements, but the novel Karakuri system gives the game a unique identity that sets it apart from its contemporaries. In the fiction of Wild Hearts, Karakuri is an ancient technology used by hunters to conjure impressive pieces of technology out of thin air.","content_length":907,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wild Hearts Review - Build Me Up","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/","post_date":"February 16, 2023 at 7:45AM PST","content":"In action, it's a fast-paced crafting system that serves multiple functions, opening up your available options both in and out of combat. You start with what are known as Basic Karakuri, the first of which lets you produce a wooden crate that launches you into the air when you climb on top of it. You can stack up to three of these crates at once to generate extra height, which proves useful when exploring the environment but really comes into its own when fighting Wild Hearts' various monsters, known as Kemono. You can launch from these crates and transition into a devastating downward strike, or utilize the added elevation to quickly avoid an area-of-effect attack that spews out a pool of lava or poisonous clouds. Most Karakuri serve a dual purpose such as this, whether it's a springboard that proves useful in dodging attacks and propelling you toward Kemono, or a glider that allows you to traverse large gaps and position yourself above monsters for an aerial barrage.","content_length":982,"content_tokens":202,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Wild Hearts Review - Build Me Up","post_url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/","post_date":"February 16, 2023 at 7:45AM PST","content":"<p class=\"av-video-player-no-js\">You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.</p> Click To Unmute PIONER Awakening Official TrailerFirearms Expert Reacts To Battlefield 2042’s Guns PART 3Stop Announcing Games So EarlyThe Expanse : A Telltale Series Story TrailerFRONT MISSION 1st: Remake || New Platforms Release TrailerGhost Trick: Phantom Detective Launch TrailerLGBTQ+ Inclusive Games You Should Check OutBLADE RUNNER 2033: LABYRINTH | Reveal Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023STORYTELLER | Coming to Netflix - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerTHIRSTY SUITORS | Release Date Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023Stray | Coming to Xbox - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 TrailerBOUNTY STAR | Gameplay Overview Trailer - Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2023 ShareLinkEmbedSize:640 × 360480 × 270 Start at: End at: Autoplay Loop Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?
